\# 164 Public Finance As the person moves up her ordinary demand curve, utility (falls, stays constant). By contrast, as the person moves up her compensated demand curve, utility (falls, stays constant). The MB curve shows how many dollars the consumer would have to be given to keep her utility \_\_\_\_\_ if she had to \_\_\_\_\_ that unit of medical care. So the MB curve is the \_\_\_\_\_ demand curve, not the \_\_\_\_\_ demand curve. Hence, the area of the efficiency loss triangle is (smaller than, the same as) the area of the triangle formed using the ordinary demand curve.
