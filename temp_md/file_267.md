\# 246 Public Finance manufacturer or the retailer. It can be imposed by the federal government and/or state governments. What should be the tax on a pack of cigarettes, a can or bottle of beer, a bottle of wine, or a bottle of liquor? Studies such as those cited in the footnotes have tried to provide estimates. We note two points here. First, tobacco and alcohol taxes have not been indexed for inflation, so Congress and legislatures must vote explicitly to raise the taxes periodically to keep up with inflation. Because the external and internal costs rise with inflation, it would seem sensible to index tobacco and alcohol taxes for inflation. Second, tobacco taxes have been raised significantly in recent years, but alcohol taxes have not; it therefore seems likely that alcohol taxes are currently below the social optimum. # Summary The U.S. federal government does not levy either of the two major consumption taxes: the retail sales tax (RST) or the value-added tax (VAT). By contrast, the national governments of most other countries levy a VAT. When economists call the RST a consumption tax, they are assuming, quite plausibly, that most of the burden falls on consumers rather than on retailers. A retail sales tax is regressive: As we move from low- to high-income households (in a given year), the ratio of tax burden to income generally falls. With a VAT, part of the tax is collected at each stage of production; at each stage, value added is defined as sales minus purchases. Because economic analysis suggests that a VAT is equivalent to a RST, it follows that a VAT is regressive just like a RST. Both a RST and a VAT are neutral between domestic and foreign goods. With both a VAT and a corporate income tax, sales revenue is added and expense on materials is subtracted. To convert the corporate income tax to a VAT, these changes must be made: No subtraction is permitted for compensation to employees, interest to creditors, or depreciation of investment goods; but a subtraction is permitted for the purchase of investment goods this year. Under a RST or a VAT, regressivity can be reduced in either of two ways: exemptions of certain necessities or (preferred by economists) cash rebates to households. Another way to reduce the regressivity of a VAT is to modify it so it becomes either the flat tax or the X tax. To obtain the flat tax, start with a VAT on firms and no income tax on households, then permit firms to deduct wage income (which is not permitted under a standard VAT), but tax households on wage income above an exemption at a single rate. The X tax is the same as the flat tax except that wage income above the exemption is taxed at graduated bracket rates (like the current U.S. income tax). It would be possible to replace the household income tax with a household consumption tax: On the annual 1040 tax return, due April 15, the household would report its consumption instead of its income. Alternatively, it would be possible to supplement the household income tax with a progressive consumption tax on very high consumption. A household would arrive at its consumption in the past calendar year by subtraction: It would sum its cash inflows and then subtract nonconsumption cash outflowsâ€”all saving would therefore be tax deductible. Like the household income tax, the household consumption tax would have progressive rates. Replacing the income tax with a consumption tax that raises the same revenue would have several effects. It would raise national saving because within each income class the tax burden would be reduced on high savers and increased on low savers, each person would have an incentive to save, and workers would postpone more lifetime tax until retirement, thereby increasing their ability to save. It would eliminate the efficiency loss between saving and consuming but would increase the efficiency loss between leisure and work, so the net effect on inefficiency is uncertain. If the
