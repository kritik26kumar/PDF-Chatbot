quintile) of households, but 10.4% for all households. Thus, the tax to income ratio for the federal income tax was roughly 60% higher (16.3%/10.4% = 1.6) for the top 20% than for the average household. # Comprehensive Income Most economists use the following definition of comprehensive income:

> A household’s comprehensive income equals its consumption plus its increase in wealth (saving). Equivalently, a household’s comprehensive income equals the maximum it could consume in a given year while holding its wealth constant.4

Saving is defined as the increase in wealth; hence, saving equals comprehensive income minus consumption. As shown in Table 8.8, suppose you begin the year on January 1 with $10,000 in your bank account and $10,000 of corporate stock, so your assets are $20,000. You’ve borrowed $5,000, so your liabilities (debt) are $5,000. Then your wealth—defined as assets minus liabilities—is $15,000. During the year, you receive $1,000 of interest from your bank and $1,000 of dividends from corporate stock; you earn $38,000 of wage income, consume $36,000, and save $4,000 in your bank account (raising your bank account to $14,000). Assuming that your corporate stock is still worth $10,000, your increase in wealth is $4,000, and your wealth at the end of the year is $19,000. Then according to the definition of comprehensive income above (consumption plus increase in wealth), your income equals your consumption ($36,000) plus your increase. 4 This is sometimes called the Haig-Simons definition of comprehensive income after the two economists who proposed it to evaluate income taxation nearly a century ago.
