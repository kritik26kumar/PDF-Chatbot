Now suppose that the employer provides $8,000 of health insurance with the job. In the supply-demand diagram, plotting cash salary on the vertical axis, the employer’s demand for labor curve will shift down $8,000. For example, if the employer was previously willing to pay a cash salary of $50,000 for the 100th worker, now it will be willing to pay a cash salary of $42,000, because it is also paying $8,000 for health insurance—for a total compensation of $50,000. The key question is this: What happens to the supply curve when a job provides $8,000 worth of health insurance? Perhaps the most likely response is shown in Figure 6.4: The S curve shifts down by $8,000. With no insurance, the 100th worker was willing to take the job for a cash salary of $50,000. With insurance given by the job, the 100th worker might be willing to take the job for a cash salary of $42,000. If so, the S curve shifts down $8,000. And if that happens, the SD intersection remains at 100 workers while the cash salary drops by $8,000, from $50,000 to $42,000. In this case, the worker has borne the entire burden of health insurance: The worker’s cash salary has fallen by $8,000, while the employer’s total compensation has remained $50,000. This case is shown in Table 6.3. It should be noted, however, that the S curve might not shift down by $8,000. If workers value health insurance less than cash salary, the supply curve would shift down by less than $8,000, and cash salary would fall less than $8,000. Conversely, if workers value the employer-provided insurance more than $8,000, the supply curve would shift down by more than $8,000, and cash salary would fall more than $8,000. Although it is therefore possible that the worker’s burden differs from $8,000, it seems reasonable to conclude that the worker bears most of the cost of insurance. # TABLE 6.3 Employee’s Cash Salary and Health Insurance for an Employee
