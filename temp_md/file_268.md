\# Chapter 9 Consumption Taxes switch is to a RST or VAT without exemptions or cash rebates, it would cause a large redistribution of the tax burden away from high-income households onto middle- and low-income households; exemptions and rebates would reduce the redistribution. If the switch is to a progressive household consumption tax, redistribution would be avoided. A consumption tax is not equivalent to a labor income tax, because a consumption tax taxes the lazy heir who never works but enjoys high consumption, while a labor income tax does not. Under a labor income tax, all tax is collected in the work stage of life, and this higher tax reduces the ability of workers to save and, hence, reduces the accumulation of capital in the economy. It can be debated which is fairer: a consumption tax or an income tax. Three ways to look at fairness were discussed: regressivity, taxing what you take versus taxing what you make, and the grasshopper and the ants. Finally, consumption taxes on a particular category of products can be used to discourage pollution, pay for transportation infrastructure, or discourage the excessive consumption of unhealthful products like tobacco and alcohol.
