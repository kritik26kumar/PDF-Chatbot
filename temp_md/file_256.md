\# Chapter 9 Consumption Taxes and feel a subtle pressure to consume more just to maintain their utility. In turn, when the merely affluent raise their consumption, unintentionally they raise the implicit standard against which the almost affluent unconsciously measure their own consumption. So it continues downward as each stratum unintentionally puts pressure on the one below it. This cascading effect begins at the top and rolls down the social strata. From this perspective, taxing very high consumption is exactly what is needed to internalize the externality—to reduce the very high consumption at the top before it generates a waterfall of disutility.4 # REPLACING THE INCOME TAX WITH A CONSUMPTION TAX Let’s analyze the impact of replacing the income tax with a consumption tax. # Impact on Saving Table 9.3 shows the impact on saving when an income tax is replaced by a consumption tax. We consider an economy with just two people, C and S. Each has $100,000 income, so with a 10% income tax, each pays $10,000 for a total of $20,000. C and S are extremists about consuming and saving: As shown in the top block, after paying income tax, C consumes the rest ($90,000), while S saves the rest ($90,000). Total saving is $90,000, all from S. Suppose the income tax is replaced by a consumption tax that raises the same revenue ($20,000). Because S consumes nothing, all $20,000 of tax revenue must come from C. In the middle block, we assume that C continues to save nothing, so C pays $20,000 in tax and consumes $80,000. Hence, the government should set the consumption tax rate at 25% ($20,000/$80,000 = 25%). Total saving increases from $90,000 to $100,000, because S increases saving from $90,000 to $100,000. The middle block shows that even if C continues to save nothing, total saving would increase (from $90,000 to $100,000). The reason is that replacement causes person S who saves to pay less tax ($0 instead of $10,000), and the person C who consumes to. Income
