\# Chapter Four # Cost-Benefit Analysis Charles Smith/Corbis Cost-benefit analysis is the measuring of the costs of a project and the benefits of a project to help decide whether to undertake the project and what the scale of the project should be. Consider these decisions facing government: Should a particular highway be built? Should improvements be made in a highway to make it safer? How much should carbon fuel use be cut (through a carbon tax or permits) to reduce global warming? Should Medicare pay for costly treatment X? Should a military intervention be undertaken? In these and many other decisions, economists recommend weighing cost against benefit to help guide the decision. In this chapter, using these examples, we examine how cost-benefit analysis can help us arrive at better decisions in the public sector. The basic principle of cost-benefit analysis is simple: A project should be undertaken if its benefit to society exceeds its cost to society. The scale of such a project should be increased as long as the marginal social benefit (MSB) exceeds the marginal social cost (MSC) so that the optimal scale occurs where MSB equals MSC. 79
