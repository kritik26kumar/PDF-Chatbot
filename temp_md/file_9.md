\# Starting a Health Insurance Company Now imagine that you’ve just graduated from college in this society, and you decide to start a health insurance company. But can you make money selling health insurance? There are many factors to consider as you crunch the numbers. Each chapter of Seidman’s Public Finance features hypothetical and real-world examples. These clear applications apply directly to the material and enable students to relate the concepts of public finance to their everyday lives, heightening the understanding of the subjects presented. Initially you assume that insurance won’t change anyone’s medical bill—5% will still have a $61,000 bill and 95% will still have a $1,000 bill—and that no one has inside information about her own health prospects, so everyone assumes her chances are 5% and 95%, respectively. For every 100 people who buy your insurance, 5 people are likely to incur a $61,000 bill, and 95 people, a $1,000 bill. Hence, your expected total bill from hospitals and doctors for your enrollees will be:

| To obtain | $61,000 | 5 | $305,000 | $95,000 | $400,000 |
| --------- | ------- | - | -------- | ------- | -------- |

In premium revenue of $400,000 from your 100 enrollees, you must charge a premium of $4,000 per enrollee. As long as you charge a premium of at least $4,000 and enrollees are willing to pay your premium, for every 100 persons you will take in at least $400,000 in revenue, thereby covering your expected cost of $400,000. # Writing Style Written with students in mind, Public Finance is an approachable text.
