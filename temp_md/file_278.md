\# Chapter 10 State and Local Public Finance Some low-income people may feel more comfortable living near other low-income people and having their children go to school with other low-income children. In this chapter, we concentrate on separation motivated by differences in income. This is not to deny that some separation is motivated by differences in race, ethnicity, or religion. We focus on separation by income to illuminate the state and local public finance problems that would arise even if everyone were the same racially, ethnically, and religiously. Separation due to race, ethnicity, or religion adds further complexity. It should be emphasized that the Tiebout process still works in a society where income differs. Each high-income town competes with other high-income towns for high-income potential residents by varying the mix of public services and taxes and by trying to be efficient—producing a given quality of public services at minimum cost and, hence, minimum taxes. Similarly, middle-income towns compete for middle-income residents. Thus, the Tiebout process still generates a desirable mix of public services and taxes among towns competing for people of a particular income level. Thus, two location processes operate simultaneously when household incomes differ in a society: the separation process and the Tiebout process. # Should a City Government Try to Tax Suburbanites? At first glance it might seem that a city government can’t tax high-income suburbanites, but it can. Many suburbanites work, shop, or get entertainment in the city. Thus, the city government can tax the wage income earned in the city by suburbanites—the tax can be withheld by businesses located in the city from employee paychecks. A city sales tax is partly borne by suburbanites who shop or get entertainment in the city. These are particular examples of tax exporting, where the aim is to export the tax burden to high-income suburbanites. Therefore, a city government does have the means to tax many suburbanites. But should it? It depends on the elasticity of suburbanites’ responses to city taxes. If the city levies a tax on the wage income earned in the city by suburbanites, some businesses may locate in the suburbs rather than the city, and some suburbanites may switch to jobs in the suburbs. If the city imposes a high sales tax, some suburbanites may shop in the suburbs, and some retailers may locate in the suburbs rather than the city. If the response is small—inelastic—then city residents may benefit because higher city revenue outweighs the slightly lower employment and wages, but if the response is large (i.e., elastic), then taxing suburbanites may turn out to be harmful for city residents. # Should a City Tax Economic Activity That Occurs within the City? It is tempting for a city to use source-based taxation—to tax labor and financial capital employed in the city as well as goods purchased in the city regardless of where the workers, investors, and consumers reside. By contrast, under residence-based taxation the city would tax only workers and investors who reside in the city. Source-based taxation is appealing because it appears to be a way to extract revenue from outsiders—it appears to be a method of tax exporting. Also, it is relatively easy to collect source-based taxes: payroll, profit, and sales taxes on business firms located in the city. However, source-based taxes can reduce the efficiency of the metropolitan economy. As we discussed, a tax on income earned in the city drives workers and businesses out of the city even if they are more productive in the city than in the suburbs. A tax on sales that occur in the city drives retailers and shoppers out of the city. Thus, it is probably more efficient to use residence-based taxation instead. Although residence-based taxation may discourage some people from living in the city, this is likely to cause
