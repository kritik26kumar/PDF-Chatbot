\# Chapter Six # Health Insurance Jupiterimages/Imagesource What role should the government play in the provision of health insurance? What would happen if the government played no role and left the provision of health insurance completely to the private sector? Alternatively, what would happen under various specific kinds of government intervention? What in fact has happened under actual government interventions? This chapter addresses these questions. For most goods and services, consumers pay the full price of anything they buy. However, most consumers of medical care—patients—pay only a portion of the price charged by the providers of medical care—doctors and hospitals. In some cases, consumers pay nothing. An insurer—either a private company or the government—often pays a large share of the price, sometimes 100%. In this chapter, we analyze why that is so, evaluate the impact of health insurance, and consider public policies for improving its performance. 131
