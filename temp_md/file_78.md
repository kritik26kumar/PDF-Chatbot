\# Chapter Three # Public Goods and Political Economy Economists rightly emphasize that competitive markets generally work well for most goods and services and that it is best for government to avoid interference in these markets. But there is a kind of good that markets cannot be expected to handle well: a public good. It is usually best for a public good to be financed by taxation and paid for by government. The actual production of the public good may be done either by government or private firms, but two problems arise. First, what is the socially optimal quantity of a particular public good? Second, how should decisions be made concerning public goods? The analysis of how government should and actually does make decisions concerning goods and services is sometimes called political economy. Once we have examined what government should do, we will then turn to how government actually behaves and makes decisions. 57
