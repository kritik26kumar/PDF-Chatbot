\# Chapter 13 Government Borrowing # Appendix # Government Borrowing The Derivation of the Formula b\* = f/g Let b equal debt as a percentage of nominal GDP. By definition, b ← B/Y where B is debt and Y is nominal GDP. If the numerator B and the denominator Y grow at the same rate, b stays constant; if B grows faster than Y, b increases; and if B grows more slowly than Y, b decreases. What happens to b is determined by the “race” between the numerator B and the denominator Y. We therefore examine the growth rate of the denominator Y and the growth rate of the numerator B. Let g be the growth rate of the denominator Y. We assume that g is constant. Let G be the growth rate of the numerator B. Then G = F/B where F is the deficit and B is the debt. For example, if debt B is $5,000 billion at the beginning of this year and the deficit F equals $500 billion this year, then debt B will be $5,500 billion at the beginning of next year, a 10% increase. Therefore, G = F/B = $500/$5,000 = 10%; then G, the growth rate of debt B, is 10%. G = F/B = (F/Y)/(B/Y) But F/Y ← f, the deficit as a percentage of GDP; and B/Y ← b, the debt as a percentage of GDP, so G = f/b We assume that f is kept constant by the government. # FIGURE 13A.1 Debt as a Percentage of GDP Debt as a percentage of GDP (b) moves to b\* where the growth rate of debt (G) equals the growth rate of nominal GDP (g). • g (Growth rate of nominal GDP) Percent growth rate G (Growth rate of debt) b\* (Debt as a percentage of GDP) b
