\# Chapter 6 Health Insurance and less than 80% for a patient with (low, high) income. This could be done by giving everyone a government credit card for medical care and billing each patient a percentage based on the patient’s *i\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ t\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_* from the last year which the government has collected.

1. If the government pays 100% instead of 80% of each patient’s medical bill there would be a new demand curve D.
2. 1. Draw D on your diagram.
2. Suppose taxpayers and the government want E to be only $10,000 so government imposes a price control of P\* $100. Then the suppliers (doctors, medical technology firms, drug firms) are only willing to supply Q \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
3. But with P $100, D is (greater, less) than Q; show this in the diagram. Many patients would be unhappy because there would be a *w\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ l\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*.
4. How many patients would be unhappy? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
5. With P\* $100, if the government makes patients pay 20% (so insurance pays 80% instead of 100%) then the *w\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ l\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_* would be (shorter than, the same as) with 100% insurance because patient demand would be (less, the same). Also, switching from 100% insurance to 80% insurance would (increase, decrease) taxes.
If there is no externality, use a diagram to explain the efficiency loss due to the insurance price subsidy.
3. If there is a positive externality, use a diagram to explain why there may be no efficiency loss due to the insurance price subsidy.
4. Using a diagram, explain who bears the burden of employer-provided insurance.
5. Explain the strategy of consumer-driven health care and health savings accounts.
6. Explain the responsible health insurance plan.
7. Describe:
8. 1. An employer mandate.
2. An employer play-or-pay option.
3. Government reinsurance.
Give the pros and cons of replacing private insurance with government insurance.
9. Discuss these possible reforms of Medicare:
10. 1. A Medicare voucher.
2. Income-related patient cost sharing.
3. Rationing.
Go online and read about the health insurance plans of the Democratic and Republican candidates for president in the 2008 election. Describe, compare, and evaluate the two plans.
11. Appendix Question: Consider Figure 6A.1. With insurance the patient pays price PL, chooses point \_\_\_\_\_, and her demand for medical care is \_\_\_\_\_. If price rises from PL to PH, the budget line would rotate, the person would move from \_\_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_\_, and her utility would (rise, fall). The person would move (up, down) her (ordinary, compensated) demand curve to \_\_\_\_\_. But suppose that as price rises from PL to PH the person is given additional \_\_\_\_\_ so her utility stays \_\_\_\_\_. Then she moves to \_\_\_\_\_. This move is called the \_\_\_\_\_ effect. The person moves (up, down) her (ordinary, compensated) demand curve from \_\_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_\_. The compensated demand curve is (steeper, flatter) than the ordinary demand curve.
