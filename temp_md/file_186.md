\# Chapter 6 Health Insurance # Appendix # Health Insurance This appendix explains why the MB curve in Figure 6.2 is the compensated demand curve (Dc) and is steeper than the ordinary demand curve (Dₒ). Figure 6A.1 is an indifference-curve/budget-line diagram applied to the good “medical care.” Before reading further, review the appendix to Chapter 1 which gives an introduction to the indifference-curve/budget-line diagram. Each point in Figure 6A.1(a) indicates a particular quantity of medical care and a particular expenditure on other goods. Any two points that give the person the same # FIGURE 6A.1
