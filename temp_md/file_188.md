\# Chapter Seven # Tax Incidence and Inefficiency SuperStock / Alamy Taxes are necessary to raise the revenue needed to finance government programs, such as national defense and Social Security. Taxes also impose burdens on people and efficiency losses on the economy. The aim of tax policy should be to try to distribute these burdens fairly (equitably) and to minimize the efficiency losses on the economy. This chapter has two parts. The first part analyzes who bears the burden from a particular tax—that is, the “incidence” of the tax. The second part analyzes the inefficiency (efficiency loss) to the economy that results from particular taxes. 167
