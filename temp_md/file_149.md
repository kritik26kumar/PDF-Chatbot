\# Public Finance # Appendix # Social Security # Your Rate of Return When You Work for 40 Years and Retire for 20 Years In the text of this chapter the rate of return was defined only for the case where there are just two stages of life—(1) the work stage and (2) the retirement stage—so r\* (B₂/T₁) 1. Suppose you want to calculate the rate of return you will get under Social Security when you work for 40 years and pay a payroll tax each year, and then retire for 20 years and receive a benefit each year. How would you calculate your r\*? There is a way to view the rate of return r\* that will let you calculate it if you work for 40 years and are retired for 20 years. Begin with r\* (B₂/T₁) 1, add 1 to both sides so (1 r\*) B₂/T₁, then multiply both sides by T₁, and divide by (1 r\*) to obtain: Thus, the rate of return r\* is the percentage that makes the two sides equal when your tax is T₁ and your benefit is B₂. In our text numerical example, $100 = $150/(1 r\*), so r\* = 50% makes the two sides equal. Another way to say this is that if the future benefit B₂ is “discounted” (divided) by 1 + r\*, the discounted benefit will equal the tax T₁. In terms of the concept of present value explained in Chapter 4: The rate of return equals the value of the discount rate that would make the present value of the benefit equal the tax. This way of viewing r\* can be applied to the case where you pay tax each year for the 40 years that you work and receive a benefit each year for the 20 years you are retired. The rate of return is the discount rate that would make the present value of your benefits equal to the present value of your taxes. Thus, your rate of return is the numerical value of r\* that makes 40 T 60 B ∑\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ∑\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ i i 1 (1 + r\*)ⁱ 41 (1 + r\*)ⁱ where Ti is the tax you pay each year you work from year 1 to year 40 Bi is the benefit you receive each year you are retired from year 41 to year 60 Σ₁⁴⁰ is the sum over the 40 years you work (years 1 to 40) Σ₄₁⁶₀ is the sum over the 20 years you are retired (years 41 to 60) If you had a numerical estimate, with the help of the Social Security Administration, of the tax Ti that you will pay each year you work for 40 years and the benefit Bi that you will receive each year you are retired for 20 years, then r\* would be the only unknown in the equation. Unfortunately, there is no way to just solve for r\*. You must find it by trial and error. You pick a number for r\* (say, 2.0%) and compute the left side by adding 40 numbers, then the right side by adding 20 numbers, and see if the two sides are approximately equal. If they are, then 2.0% is your estimated rate of return. If they aren’t equal, pick another number for r\* and try again. Of course, this would be very time-consuming.
