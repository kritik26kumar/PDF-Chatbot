\# Chapter 10 State and Local Public Finance Funds from high-income people in suburbs to low-income people in cities or from high-income states to low-income states, but it is a poor instrument for inducing an increase in spending on activity X. A conditional block grant gives the recipient Z dollars to spend on activity X. If the recipient would have spent less than Z dollars on activity X without the grant, then this grant will increase what the recipient spends on X. However, suppose that the recipient would have spent more than Z dollars on X had there been no grant. Then the conditional block grant should increase spending on X by no more than an unconditional block grant. Why? Because the local government should simply cut its own funds for X by Z dollars, use the Z dollars of the grant for X, and then use the Z dollars it saves however it wants. Yet, surprisingly, some researchers have found that a conditional block grant sometimes increases spending on X more than an unconditional block grant. This has been called the flypaper effect because the money “sticks where it hits,” and the recipient does not reallocate its own funds to other uses. A closed-ended categorical matching grant has a limit. Once the ceiling is reached, there is no further matching by the grantor. If the recipient is initially below the ceiling, then this grant gives the recipient a price incentive to expand X until it reaches the ceiling. If the recipient would have reached the ceiling without the grant, then this closed-ended categorical matching grant should be no better than an unconditional grant in stimulating X—it has an income effect but no price effect. Unless there is a significant flypaper effect, the ceiling weakens the grant’s impact on activity X. For example, suppose without the grant, the recipient would have chosen 10 units of X at a price of $20 per unit, so that it would have spent $200 on X. Consider a dollar-for-dollar matching grant for X with a ceiling of $100. Then once the recipient uses 5 units and spends $100, it receives $100 from the grantor—the ceiling. For any additional units, it receives no match and must pay the full price per unit of $20. True, the grant has given the recipient $100; with this additional $100 of income, it may use a bit more of X. But it has no price incentive to do so. So why does the grantor put a ceiling on the categorical matching grant? Because the grantor has its own budget constraint and wants to limit its own spending. But is there any way to limit its spending but still give the recipient a price incentive? The answer is by using an incremental open-ended categorical matching grant. With an incremental matching grant, the match begins only after the recipient has first spent Z dollars on the activity (the threshold); but then there is no ceiling. Thus, the grantor does not “waste” its money matching units the recipient would have bought anyway. The grantor conserves funds to get a price effect at the margin. The incremental grant is clever, but it does have a problem. The incremental grant would work perfectly if the grantor knew how much each recipient would have bought without the grant and sets each recipient’s threshold accordingly. But the grantor can’t be sure how many units the recipient would have bought anyway. If the grantor accidentally sets the threshold higher than the recipient would have spent on its own, then the recipient may not respond at all to the grant. Thus, the lower the threshold is set, the more likely the recipient will respond, but the more funds the grantor will waste matching units that would have been bought anyway. Furthermore, no matter what criterion is used to set the threshold, some recipients will complain that it favors other recipients. Thus, devising a criterion for setting the threshold is a challenge facing the designer of an incremental grant. Another purpose of a grant formula could be to equalize fiscal capacity, the ability of a community to finance public services. Consider two communities—H (high income) and L (low income). If they make the same tax effort by setting the same.
