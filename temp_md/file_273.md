\# (b) State/local spending (% of total spending) There has been an increase in the percentage devoted to health. Today, state and local governments together receive roughly 25% of their revenue from sales taxes, 20% from property taxes, 15% from income taxes, and 20% from federal grants. Since 1965 there has been a big increase in the percentage of revenue that comes from income taxes and from federal grants. In Chapters 7 through 9 on taxation, we examined all the taxes used by federal, state, and local governments except the property tax. We postponed treatment of the property tax until this chapter because it is used almost exclusively by local governments. Most local governments obtain more than half their tax revenue from the property tax. The local property tax is levied on residences and businesses, and it is usually a flat percentage of the assessed property value of the residence or business. Later in this chapter, we devote a section to the analysis of the local property tax. Federalism refers to the assignment of some government spending programs and taxes to the federal government, others to state governments, and others to local governments (towns, cities, counties, and school districts). Which level of government should do what? Optimal federalism refers to the particular assignment of programs and taxes to particular levels of government that best promotes the well-being of the citizenry. Political scientists have offered important reasons to explain why tasks should be divided among several levels of government rather than being concentrated in a single level of government. This chapter gives the perspective of economists on which programs and taxes should be assigned to which levels of government.
