\# Public Finance Tax rate on income or property, H will raise more revenue per resident than L. A grant formula could target more dollars to L and less to H, so that if L sets the same tax rate as H, it will achieve the same revenue (tax plus grant) per resident as H does. # Summary State and local governments spend and tax roughly half as much as the federal government (10% of GDP versus 20% of GDP). Education constitutes about 35% of state and local spending. In contrast to the federal government, the sales tax is an important revenue source for state government, the property tax for local government. If household incomes were similar, there is an advantage to letting local governments provide differing packages of public services and taxes. Through the Tiebout process, local governments engage in a marketlike competition for potential residents that benefits most households in society. There would still be a role for state government in public services that involve externalities or economies of scale. Household incomes differ, and most households probably want to live in a locality where most other residents have high incomes. Although the Tiebout process continues to work, there is also a separation process where the affluent move away from the nonaffluent, the nonaffluent try to follow, but the affluent use zoning to maintain their separation. The separation process and the Tiebout process operate simultaneously. If low-income cities try to tax affluent suburbanites, affluent residents, or business firms, it may drive them away and prove counterproductive for low-income city residents. An alternative strategy is to have the state government levy taxes and use grants to redistribute income from affluent suburbs to low-income cities. This strategy is analyzed in a case study of the city of Philadelphia. The most important tax for local governments is the property tax which is levied on residences and business firms. Economists have considered three different approaches to analyzing the burden of a residential property tax: traditional, benefit, and capital. According to the traditional approach, a property tax is a tax on a good—a home—and the division of the burden depends on the relative elasticities of the supply and demand for homes. The benefit approach points out that people benefit from the public services financed by the property tax; this leads to the conclusion that home buyers bear the burden of paying for the public service from which they benefit. According to the capital approach, homes are just one form in which people accumulate wealth; hence, a property tax causes investors to divert their saving away from homes and into other forms of capital, thereby driving down the return to all forms of capital. There are arguments for and against the residential property tax. Advocates note that it doesn’t discourage economic activity in the community in contrast to other taxes; it generates predictable revenue; it is easy to administer and comply with; and it is a fair tax in that it roughly reflects ability to pay and the benefit derived from public services. Critics note that the property tax causes more of a cash-flow problem for some taxpayers than other taxes do; that it causes a substantial burden for some retirees; and that assessed values are poor measures of market values of homes and hence are an unfair basis for levying a tax. There are three main purposes for grants from a higher government to lower governments: the existence of a positive externality, achieving a goal of the higher government, and redistribution. A matching grant provides more stimulus for activity X than a block grant because it has a price as well as an income effect.
