\# Chapter 3 Public Goods and Political Economy Executives surely have an incentive to be reelected, but it is not obvious that expanding government is always the best way to be reelected. For example, Presidents Reagan and George W. Bush were successful in getting elected by promising tax and spending cuts. Similarly, many legislators have been successful in elections by giving a high priority to cutting taxes and spending. Bureaucrats no doubt want to expand their departments and programs, but it is legislators (with the approval of the executive), not bureaucrats, who decide the size of departments and programs. Some constitutional limits may be useful, but others may impose a straitjacket that prevents desired flexibility by government. For example, in a recession, government budgets automatically go into deficit because tax revenues drop, and a requirement to promptly balance the budget (which can only be achieved by either raising taxes or cutting government spending) is likely to reduce demand, thereby making the recession worse, so any balanced budget requirement must be carefully drawn to avoid this problem (this issue is discussed in Chapter 13 on government borrowing). # Summary A public good is a good or service that has two properties: (1) nonexcludability and (2) nonrivalry. Nonexcludability means that it is hard to exclude any person—even if the person won’t pay for it—from benefiting from the good or service. Nonrivalry means that consumption by one person of the good or service does not prevent consumption by other people; in fact, all individuals simultaneously consume the same quantity of the good. Nonexcludability means that it is hard to get many individuals to voluntarily pay for a public good because each person knows that he can’t be excluded from benefiting if the good is produced, so each is tempted to be a free rider who benefits without paying. The standard approach to the free-rider problem is taxation. Because everyone benefits, everyone should be compelled to contribute. The problems posed by a public good were illustrated through the example of an island wall. The three families on the island must decide whether to have a defensive wall built, and if so, how thick it should be. Given the preferences of the three families and the cost of the wall, there is a socially optimal wall thickness. If the families agree to share the cost of the wall in proportion to their benefit, they will unanimously agree on how thick to make the wall. But if the cost-shares are assigned differently, they will disagree on how thick to make the wall. If they are unwilling to alter the cost-shares to achieve unanimity, they will need a mechanism to break the deadlock. Majority-rule voting is one mechanism. Sometimes majority-rule voting works well and yields the social optimum as a stable, clear winner. However, other times majority-rule voting does not yield the social optimum, and sometimes it does not even yield a stable, clear winner. Political economy is the study of how government should behave with respect to goods and services and how it actually behaves. We considered legislators, policies, elections, logrolling, lobbying, special interests, campaign financing, bureaucracies, corruption, public choice, government failure, and constitutions.
