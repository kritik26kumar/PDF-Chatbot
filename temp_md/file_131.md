When a demographic shift reduces the ratio of workers to retirees, then unpleasant consequences must follow: Either the replacement rate must fall, or the tax rate must be raised, or both. To see this, let’s consider a hypothetical numerical example. In a workers-support-retirees system, benefits paid out each year equal tax revenues paid in, so BR = tWL ($45)(100) = (.15)($100)(300) where B = the benefit per retiree ($45), R = the number of retirees (100), t = the payroll tax rate (15%), W = the wage per worker ($100), L = the number of workers (300). This year, total benefits paid out equal total taxes paid in ($4,500). Here we simplify by assuming all wage income is subject to payroll tax. Note that the ratio of the benefit ($45) to the wage per worker ($100), the replacement rate B/W, equals 45%. Dividing by W, and then by R, yields: B (L) \_\_ t \_\_ W R $45 (300) \_\_\_\_\_ (.15) \_\_\_\_ $100 100 .45 (.15)(3) Suppose that as time passes, the number of retirees gradually rises from 100 to 150 while the number of workers remains at 300; the ratio of workers to retirees, L/R, gradually falls from 3 (300/100) to 2 (300/150). Then either the replacement rate B/W must
