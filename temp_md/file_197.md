\# Public Finance The machine that costs $100. The machine generates additional revenue of $4 per year—a rate of return of 4% on the $100 investment. The saver is paid $4 interest—a rate of return of 4% on the $100 of saving. Figure 7.5 shows the effect of a tax levied on the capital income that savers earn. Consider a 40% tax on capital income. Suppose a person saves $100. If he earned interest income of $5 before tax, he must pay a tax of $2 (40% of $5) and therefore would keep $3. Hence, a 40% tax implies that if he earns a 5% return before tax, he would receive a 3% return after tax. According to the S curve in Figure 7.5, people would save ST if there were a 3% return and no tax; with a 40% tax, they would save ST if they earned a 5% return before tax, so they could keep 3% after tax. Hence, this tax would shift up the saving supply curve to S because it would now take a before-tax return of 5%, not 3%, to induce people to save ST. Because the tax is 40%, the height of each point on S is 60% of the height of the point above it on S, so S is not parallel to S—S is slightly steeper than S. With the relative elasticities as drawn, the 40% capital income tax causes the market rate of return to rise from 4% to 5%; the savers send 2% to the government and keep 3% after tax. Savers bear a 1% burden, and borrowers bear a 1% burden. # How Elastic Is Saving Supply? Suppose a tax on capital income is eliminated, raising the after-tax return rₙ a saver receives. Will the person’s saving increase or decrease? As in the case of labor supply, there are two opposing tendencies. On the one hand, the reward to a dollar of saving is greater; this would tend to increase a person’s saving. On the other hand, if the person has a target expenditure he wants to make, he can save less and still achieve it. Economists call the increase in saving when the reward to a dollar of saving increases the substitution effect; they call the decrease in saving needed to reach a target expenditure the income effect.3 As in the case of labor supply, economists have used a variety of methods to try to determine how saving would actually respond to a rise in the after-tax return rₙ. Using either time-series or cross-section analysis, some economists have found that saving is inelastic, while other economists have found a positive elasticity. Although there is a wide variation of estimates from econometric studies, the average estimate is roughly the following: If the after-tax return increases about 33% (for example, from 3% to 4%; an increase of 1% starting from 3% is a 33% increase), saving increases about 10%. Another way to say this is that the saving elasticity is about 0.3 (10%/33%), where the elasticity is defined as the ratio of the percentage change in saving (10%) to the percentage change in the after-tax return (33%). # General Equilibrium Tax Incidence Thus far we have analyzed the impact of a tax in a single market with a single supply and demand curve. This is called partial equilibrium analysis. Sometimes, however, it is important to take account of the interaction between markets. This is called general equilibrium analysis. # The Impact of a Capital Income Tax on the Wage When the 40% tax on capital income shown in Figure 7.5 is imposed, what happens in the labor market? If the tax reduces the capital stock (machinery), this will reduce the productivity of labor (assuming capital and labor are complements in the production. 3 The appendix to this chapter gives a further analysis of the income and substitution effects using an indifference-curve/budget-line diagram.
