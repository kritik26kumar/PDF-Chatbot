\# 272 Public Finance # Appendix # State and Local Public Finance Figure 10A.1 shows the effect of an open-ended matching grant (a matching grant with no ceiling or limit) from the state government to a local community for activity X and compares it to the effect of an equal unconditional block grant or a conditional block grant for activity X. Assume a unit of X has a price of $20. Suppose the local community has an income of $2,000. If it spends its entire income on X, it can buy 100 units. The slope of the community’s budget line is –$20. The budget line is AB. The community, like an individual, is assumed to have indifference curves for combinations of X and spending Y on other goods (review the appendix to Chapter 1 that introduces the indifference-curve/budget-line diagram). Without the matching grant, the community chooses point O and buys 20 units of X. Suppose the state offers a dollar-for-dollar matching grant for activity X, so m is 1, and the price of X is reduced 50% from $20 to $10 (to get a unit of X, now the local community only has to put up $10, and the state puts up the other $10 to make $20). With the matching grant, the community’s budget line rotates and gets flatter (its slope is –$10), so that it hits the x axis at 200; the new budget line is AC. Clearly, the price reduction will cause the community to choose a larger quantity of X—for example, as shown in the diagram, the community chooses point M (“matching”), raising X from 20 to 30 (in this example, the 50% reduction in price induces the community to increase its quantity of X by 50% from 20 to 30 units). The total matching grant from the state is $300 ($10 × 30). Suppose instead that the state gave the community a $300 grant that the community could use for any purpose. This unconditional block grant of $300 would shift up the
