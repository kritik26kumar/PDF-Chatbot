\# Questions

1. Fill in the blanks of the 1040 Income Tax Return for this family of four (assume none of the income is capital gains or dividends):

* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ $50,000
* Adjustments $ 50
* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (\_\_\_\_\_) $49,950
* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (4 $3,500) $14,000
* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_or \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ $10,900
* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ $\_\_\_\_\_\_
* Tentative \_\_\_\_ $\_\_\_\_\_\_
* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ $ 2,000
* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ $\_\_\_\_\_\_
* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ $ 800
* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ $\_\_\_\_\_\_

2. Fill in all the percentages in the table. Then show how the tentative \_\_\_ in question 1 is calculated:

| Taxable Income       | Tax Rate    |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| $0 to $16,050        | \_\_\_\_\_% |
| $16,050 to $65,100   | \_\_\_\_\_% |
| $65,100 to $131,450  | \_\_\_\_\_% |
| $131,450 to $200,300 | \_\_\_\_\_% |
| $200,300 to $357,700 | \_\_\_\_\_% |
| Over $357,700        | \_\_\_\_\_% |

3. For the family above, the tax is \_\_\_\_\_\_ % of its taxable income and \_\_\_\_\_\_% of its total income.

4. If a household with $357,700 of labor income earns another $10,000 of labor income, the household’s tax will increase $\_\_\_\_\_\_; but if that household earns $10,000 of dividends or capital gains, the household’s tax will increase $\_\_\_\_\_\_.

5. List four important itemized deductions:

* a. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
* b. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
* c. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
* d. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
