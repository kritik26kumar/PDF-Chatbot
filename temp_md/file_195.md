| $12.40—to the government. Your pay stub from your employer indicates that your gross pay is $100 and your net pay is $93.80; your pay stub does not indicate how much your employer is sending the government. From your pay stub, it might be natural for you to think that your burden from the payroll tax is $6.20—natural but incorrect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |         |         |        |
| To figure out your burden from the payroll tax, you need to know what would have happened if there had been no tax. Figure 7.4 uses the tax wedge shortcut. What matters is relative elasticities. If S is less elastic (steeper) than D as drawn in Figure 7.4, then without the tax, your daily wage would have been greater than $100—for example, $103.80. With the tax, you receive $93.80, so your burden is $10.00 ($103.80 – $93.80). Your employer pays you $93.80 and sends $12.40 to the government, a total of $106.20, so your employer’s burden is $2.40 ($106.20 – $103.80). |         |         |        |

\# How Elastic Is Labor Supply? Suppose a wage tax is eliminated, raising the after-tax (net) wage wₙ that a worker receives. Will the number of hours a person wants to work (supply) increase or decrease? On the one hand, the reward per hour of work is greater; this would tend to increase the hours a person wants to work. On the other hand, if the person has a target expenditure he wants to make, he can now work less and still achieve it. Economists call the increase in hours because the reward per hour rises the substitution effect, and they call the decrease in hours needed to reach a target expenditure the income effect.² Economists have used a variety of methods to try to determine how workers would actually respond to a rise in the after-tax wage wₙ. Economists analyze time-series data or cross-section data. Each method has the potential to provide useful information, but each must be used and interpreted with caution. Under time-series analysis, we observe how wages and hours worked have changed as time passed. Under cross-section analysis, we observe in a given year how wages and hours vary across persons. It is important to try to take account of the influence of factors other than wages that may be influencing hours worked in order to isolate the effect of the wage on hours. ² The appendix to this chapter gives a further analysis of the income and substitution effects by using an indifference-curve/budget-line diagram.
