Most of your 2008 income tax. Suppose you owe $8,188 in tax for 2008, but your employers have already withheld $7,000 from your paychecks. Then when you mail in your 1040 tax return, you should include a check for $1,188 to the U.S. Treasury. Suppose instead that your employers have withheld $9,000. Then on your 1040 tax return, you should request a refund of $812; a few weeks later you would receive a check for $812 from the U.S. Treasury. Now let’s look at Table 8.2 to see how you determine your 2008 tax. You add up your household’s wage income plus investment income to get your household’s total income of $100,000. You are allowed to subtract a few adjustments ($4,000), resulting in your adjusted gross income (AGI) of $96,000. You subtract your personal exemptions, one for each member of your household. Imagine you and your spouse have two children; then you get four personal exemptions. Each exemption is $3,500 in 2008 (the exemption is automatically adjusted with inflation each year), so four exemptions are $14,000. You choose between a set of itemized deductions and the standard deduction; naturally, you choose whichever is larger. The standard deduction is $10,900 in 2008 (the standard deduction is automatically adjusted with inflation each year). Your itemized deductions are shown in Table 8.3. Because your total itemized deductions ($12,000) exceeds the standard deduction ($10,900), you choose the itemized deductions. Subtracting your personal exemptions ($14,000) and your itemized deductions ($12,000) from your AGI ($96,000) yields your taxable income ($70,000). Out of your $100,000 of total income, the first $30,000 ($4,000 + $14,000 + $12,000) is not subject to tax—or, equivalently, it is taxed at a 0% rate. Thus, the adjustments, personal exemptions, and the standard or itemized deductions mean that the first X dollars (in your case, $30,000) of a household’s income are taxed at a 0% rate. How do you proceed from your taxable income of $70,000 to your tentative tax of $10,188? If some of your investment income is from capital gains and dividends—for example, $5,000—then you would divide your $70,000 of taxable income into.
