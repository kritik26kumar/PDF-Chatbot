\# Chapter 3 Public Goods and Political Economy close to its cost, and the free market for private goods will work efficiently on the island without any cooperation by the families with each other. However, suppose another ship with a construction crew visits the island offering to produce a public good: a defensive wall around the island. Without a wall, the island is vulnerable to a raid by pirates. The wall is a public good because an islander who refuses to pay can’t be excluded from benefiting from the wall. The thicker the wall, the better the protection. To simplify, assume that any wall that is built has the same height, uses the same material, and surrounds the entire island; the only issue is how thick to make the wall. # The Socially Optimal Quantity of the Public Good Before we examine what the three families will do, let’s figure out what they should do by using Figure 3.1. The height of each family’s MB curve shows the maximum dollar amount that family would pay for an additional foot of thickness. We assume that each family would pay most for the first foot and then less for each additional foot. We label the families H (high), M (medium), and L (low) according to the height of the family’s MB curve. Family H (high MB) would pay a higher dollar amount for each foot than family M (medium MB), who in turn would pay a higher amount than family L (low MB). Note that the letter H, M, or L refers to the MB, not the income, of the family. # FIGURE 3.1 # The Socially Optimal Quantity of a Public Good
