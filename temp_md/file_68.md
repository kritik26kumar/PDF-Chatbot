H would want to emit 40, so it would demand 15 extra permits; hence with the total supply of excess permits (15) equal to the total demand for extra permits (15), the price would stay $40. By contrast, if the price were $20, L would want to emit 30, so it would demand 5 extra permits, and H would want to emit 45, so it would demand 20 extra permits; hence with the total demand for extra permits (25) greater than the total supply of excess permits (0), the price would rise. And if the price were $60, L would want to emit 0, so it would supply 25 excess permits, and H would want to emit 35, so it would demand 10 extra permits; hence with the total supply of excess permits (25) greater than the total demand for extra permits (10), the price would fall. Thus, the price would end up $40. In the middle block of the table, the government gives L 45 and H 5 permits. If the price were $40, L would want to emit 10, so it would supply 35 excess permits, and H would want to emit 40, so it would demand 35 extra permits; hence with the total supply of excess permits (35) equal to the total demand for extra permits (35), the price would stay $40. By contrast, if the price were $20, L would want to emit 30, so it would supply 15 excess permits, and H would want to emit 45, so it would demand 40 extra permits; hence with the total demand for extra permits (40) greater than the total supply of excess permits (15), the price would rise. If the price were $60, L would want to emit 0, so it would supply 45 excess permits, and H would want to emit 35, so it would demand 30 extra permits; hence with the total supply of excess permits (45) greater than the total demand for extra permits (30), the price would fall. Thus, the price would end up $40. In the bottom block of the table, the government gives L 5 and H 45 permits. If the price were $40, L would want to emit 10, so it would demand 5 extra permits, and H would want to emit 40, so it would supply 5 excess permits; hence with the total supply of excess permits (5) equal to the total demand for extra permits (5), the price would stay $40. By contrast, if the price were $20, L would want to emit 30, so it would demand 25 extra permits, and H would want to emit 45, so it would demand...
