\# 28 Public Finance A negative externality exists whenever producers or consumers do not have to pay for a cost they generate. Suppose there is a significant cost generated by the production of good X—for example, damage to the environment—that is not charged to the producers of X. With a negative externality, output of good X is too high because producers or consumers of the good ignore a cost of the good that is external to them—a cost they do not have to pay. For example, firms produce too much of a polluting good (a good that generates pollution when it is produced or consumed) because the cost of pollution to society is external to the polluting firms—they are not charged for using air and water quality the way they are charged for using labor or materials. A positive externality exists whenever producers or consumers do not receive payment for a benefit they generate. With a positive externality, output of good M (for example, medical care) is too low because producers or consumers of the good ignore a benefit of the good that is external to them—a benefit to others. For example, too few people get flu immunizations because they ignore the benefit to others who would not catch the flu from them. Positive externalities are important in medical care and education, and we analyze these positive externalities in Chapters 6 and 11. # THE ECONOMIST’S APPROACH TO POLLUTION # Environmental Pollution Economists generally recommend a particular kind of intervention by government to reduce (abate) environmental pollution. They recommend that the government charge polluters a price in order to discourage pollution. The greater the environmental harm from a pollutant, the higher should be the price for emitting it. The price can take two forms: a pollution tax or a permit price. Whichever form the pollution price takes, it would confront producers with the environmental cost of their production. Before polluting, they would consider the cost and therefore consider shifting to a production process entailing less pollution. If they continue polluting, they would try to pass on the cost to consumers through a higher product price, and the higher price would give consumers an incentive to shift away from a product that entailed pollution. The result would be a reduction in pollution. If the government levies a pollution tax or sells permits, it raises revenue. But the aim is to reduce pollution, not raise government revenue. Therefore, the government should return the revenue to the population by cutting other taxes or sending out cash rebates to households. If the pollution revenue is recycled in this way, then the tax burden on the population would not increase; the pollution taxes would be revenue replacers, not revenue raisers. Although revenue recycling would remove part of the burden on people from pollution taxes, people would still bear some burden because they would consume less of certain goods—namely goods that entail pollution. However, they would benefit from the improved environmental quality. Most economists regard pollution as an example of a market failure—an allocation of resources by the market that is not socially optimal. Why does the market fail? The problem is that no one owns the air and water—in other words, there is a failure of property rights. When something is free, it is used wastefully. By contrast, anything that is owned is seldom free because, naturally, the owner insists on charging a price for its use. Any potential user is deterred from frivolous use. But who owns the air above city C or the water in river R? No one owns it, so no one charges a price for using it—that is, polluting it. In a free market, consequently, pollution is excessive.
