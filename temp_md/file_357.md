\# 336 Public Finance Because G f/b, with f kept constant, as b gets larger, G gets smaller, as shown in Figure 13A.1. The figure plots b, debt as a percentage of GDP, on the horizontal axis, and G, the growth rate of B, and g, the growth rate of Y, on the vertical axis. Then G is a curve that declines as b increases, and g is a horizontal line that stays constant as b increases. Call b\* the value of b where the G curve intersects the g line. If b is less than b\* (so b is to the left of b\* in the diagram), then G is greater than g. Therefore, B grows faster than Y, and b â¬… B/Y increases until b equals b\*. If b is greater than b\* (so b is to the right of b\* in the diagram), G is less than g. Therefore, B grows more slowly than Y, and b decreases until b equals b\*. Thus, if f and g stay constant, the economy will converge to b\* where

| G   | g |
| --- | - |
| f/b | g |

Then b\* is the value of b that satisfies this equation; solving for b yields b\* = f/g
