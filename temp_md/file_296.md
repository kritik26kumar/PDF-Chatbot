\# Chapter Eleven # Education Getty Images This chapter is divided into three parts: coverage of what schools do, elementary and secondary education (grades K–12), and higher education (college, vocational school, and graduate education). # WHAT SCHOOLS DO In order to analyze what role government should or should not play in schooling, it is important to recognize that schools provide a set of distinct services. Some services primarily benefit students, but some services also benefit the rest of society, providing a positive externality that may justify a subsidy. Let’s consider the distinct services that schools provide. # Skills, Knowledge, and Human Capital Most obviously, schools teach specific skills and knowledge that will raise a student’s future economic productivity. Elementary schools teach reading and math, secondary schools and colleges teach various subjects with direct job relevance, and college courses often impart particular knowledge that will make a graduate more productive.
