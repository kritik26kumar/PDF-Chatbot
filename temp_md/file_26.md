The supply curve shifts up. $14 $12 T = $4 $10 T = $4 $8 D Q 90 100 In Figure 1.3, a tax of $4 per unit levied on consumers decreases the price that consumers are willing to pay producers by $4 because the consumer has to send $4 to the government for each unit bought. This shifts down their demand curve $4 to D⬘, so the market moves to the intersection of D⬘ and S, decreasing the quantity from 100 to 90. Note that the consumer pays a price of $8 to the producer and a tax of $4 to the government. Whether the $4 tax is levied on producers or consumers, it causes the same decrease in quantity from 100 to 90 and therefore the same amount of inefficiency. The magnitude of the inefficiency from the $4 per unit tax (whether levied on producers or consumers) equals the area of the triangle BAD in Figure 1.4. Why? Starting at 90 units (the quantity under the tax), for each additional unit there would be a net gain to society equal to the vertical distance MB-MC; no further net gains would be possible once MB equals MC. Adding the vertical distances MB-MC, unit by unit, yields the
