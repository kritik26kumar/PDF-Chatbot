\# Questions Questions 1 to 4 refer to the production of good X.

1. Production of good X generates pollution. Draw a supply-demand diagram for good X (assume the market is competitive). Assume that initially the government has no environmental policy. Your diagram should have three straight lines: label them S, D, and MSC (marginal social cost). S and D intersect at point K. Assume the environmental damage per unit of good X is $30. With no policy, 100 units of X are produced and the price of a unit of X is $120, but the socially optimal (best) amount of X, taking account of the environmental damage, is 60 units, shown at point I. Show all these numbers and points K and I on your diagram.

2. For the 100th unit of good X:

* a. What is the marginal benefit (MB) to consumers? $\_\_\_\_\_\_
* b. What is the marginal private cost of production (MPC)? $\_\_\_\_\_\_
* c. What is the marginal damage (MD) to the environment? $\_\_\_\_\_\_
* d. What is the marginal social cost (MSC)? $\_\_\_\_\_\_
* e. What is the marginal net loss to society? $\_\_\_\_\_\_

3. Using your diagram from question 1, label the triangle IJK that shows the net loss to society from the production of units 61 through 100; the net loss is $\_\_\_\_\_\_.

4. What tax per unit of good X would achieve the social optimum? $\_\_\_\_\_\_

* a. This tax will shift the S curve (up, down), so the price of X will (increase, decrease) and the quantity of X will (increase, decrease).
* b. Give the letters of the area that shows the environmental benefit: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Hint: Youâ€™ll need a new letter H); the environmental benefit is $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
* c. Give the letters of the area that shows the loss to society (ignoring the environmental gain) from the (increase, decrease) in the quantity of X: \_\_\_\_\_\_; the loss is $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
* d. Give the letters of the area that shows the net gain to society (the environmental benefit minus the loss to society from less X): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_; the net gain is $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

5. Draw Figure 2.5 with firms H and L except that each firm emits 60 (not 50) with no policy, the marginal damage (MD) of each emission is $48 (not $40), the vertical intercept of MACH is $240 (not $200), and the vertical intercept of MACL is $60 (not $50).

6. It is best for society to reduce an emission whenever MAC is less than (MD, tax).

7. It is best for a firm to reduce an emission when MAC is less than (MD, tax).

8. A tax of $\_\_\_ would induce the firms to achieve what is best for society.
