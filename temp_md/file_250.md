\# Chapter 9 Consumption Taxes

| Burdens from           | Income   | Consumption | Tax     | Saving  | Tax/Income |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- | ------- | ---------- |
| a 25% Retail Sales Tax | $20,000  | $16,000     | $4,000  | $0      | 20%        |
|                        | $100,000 | $60,000     | $15,000 | $25,000 | 15         |

Note that in this example, consumption is the amount that the household spends excluding the sales tax. Including the sales tax, the $100,000 household spends $75,000 and the $20,000 household spends $20,000. Thus, the tax equals 20% of the amount each person spends including the tax ($15,000/$75,000 = 20% and $4,000/$20,000 = 20%). Economists say that 25% is the tax-exclusive rate—the percentage that the consumer would actually see on the sales receipt, which is the rate that is applied to the sticker price—while 20% is the tax-inclusive rate. # A VALUE-ADDED TAX A value-added tax (VAT) is a percentage tax on the value that is added at each stage of production. Table 9.2 shows how a 10% value-added tax works. The top block of Table 9.2 shows how the VAT applies to the production of a consumption good—bread. The farmer grows wheat and sells it to the miller, who then grinds it into flour and sells it to the baker, who then uses the flour to bake bread and sells the bread to the consumer. With a VAT, tax is collected at each stage of production. At each stage, value added is defined as sales minus purchases, so the farmer pays $3 of tax (10% of $30), the miller pays $4 of tax (10% of $40), and the baker pays $3 of tax (10% of $30), for a total of $10. Note that the total value added is $100, which is equal to the value of the final product (the bread) sold to the consumer. One way for the miller to compute his VAT would be to take $70 of sales, subtract $30 of purchases to get $40, and then take 10% to get $4. More generally, T = t(S - P) Miller: $4 = .1($70 - $30) where t is the tax rate, S is sales revenue, and P is purchases. This is called the subtraction method. Another way for the miller to compute his VAT would be to take 10% of his $70 of sales to get a tentative tax of $7, but then subtract a tax credit equal to 10% of his $30 of purchases which is $3, so that his final tax is $7 - $3 = $4. More generally, T = tS - tP Miller: $4 = .1($70) - .1($30)

| Purchases | Sales | Value-Added | VAT  |     |
| --------- | ----- | ----------- | ---- | --- |
| Farmer    | $0    | $30         | $30  | $3  |
| Miller    | $30   | $70         | $40  | $4  |
| Baker     | $70   | $100        | $30  | $3  |
| Total     | $100  | $200        | $100 | $10 |
