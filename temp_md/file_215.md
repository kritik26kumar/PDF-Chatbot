When the after-tax interest rate increases (from 6% to 9%), each $1.00 of present consumption has a “price” of $1.09 of future consumption instead of $1.06—the person must give up $1.09 of future consumption instead of $1.06 to enjoy $1.00 of present consumption. This higher price of present consumption in itself gives the person an incentive to substitute future consumption for present consumption. In the diagram, the move from point A to point s is the substitution effect. At point A, the slope of the indifference curve (strictly speaking, the slope of a tangent to the indifference curve) is –1.06, the slope of the budget line when the after-tax interest rate is 6%. From point A, move northwest along that indifference curve until its slope reaches –1.09. Clearly,
