\# 304 Public Finance Funding; and changed the name of the program from Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) in order to emphasize that aid to any family would be temporary. In the late 1990s, the Welfare Reform Act, a strong economy, and the expansion of the EITC together cut the number of people on welfare in half and induced many recipients to go to work. # Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) is a joint federal-state program that provides cash benefits to low-income families with children in which one parent is absent; most TANF recipients are mothers. A family with no income receives the maximum TANF benefit. As family income increases, the benefit is phased down as shown in Figure 12.1(b). The maximum benefit and the phase-down rate vary substantially across states. The benefit in the highest-benefit states is several times greater than the benefit in the lowest-benefit states. The phase-down rate in most states is high, so most recipients face a substantial marginal tax rate and discouragement to work. Under TANF, the federal government imposes time limits and other restrictions on recipients. There are two federal time limits. Under the first, recipients must go to work after receiving benefits for 24 consecutive months (a state can require work sooner). Under the second, over a lifetime, a recipient cannot receive more than 60 months of benefits. The federal government requires that half of a state’s TANF recipients be working. Teenage mothers cannot qualify for benefits unless they live with their parents and stay in school; the benefit is cut for mothers who won’t identify the father; and a state is permitted to impose a family cap—a limit on how many children it will support per family. TANF also limited the federal government’s expenditure obligation for welfare. Previously, the federal government had an open-ended commitment to match state spending for every recipient who qualified for welfare. Under TANF, the federal government gives a fixed block grant to each state for welfare, so federal welfare spending no longer varies automatically with state welfare spending or with the number of recipients who qualify for welfare. This limit on the federal obligation gives each state government a stronger incentive to try to limit its own spending and to limit the number who qualify for welfare, because the state will not automatically receive any additional help from the federal government. # TANF Replaced AFDC Aid to Families with Dependent Children was enacted as part of the Social Security Act of 1935. It was a joint federal-state program in which the federal government matched each state’s share. Its purpose was to assist widows with children; at the time there were few divorces and few mothers who had never married. As the decades passed, both divorced and never-married mothers increased, and AFDC coverage was extended to these mothers and their children. As more women in society began working for pay instead of staying at home full time, many citizens came to the view that paid work should also be expected of poor mothers. When moderate Democrat Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, he promised to reform welfare in this direction. When Republicans won the House and Senate in the 1994 election, they drafted welfare reform legislation that replaced AFDC with TANF. After negotiation with Congress, and despite opposition from some liberal Democrats, President Clinton signed the Welfare Reform Act. By the end of the 1990s, the number on welfare had been cut in half and has remained low since, even through the 2001 recession.
