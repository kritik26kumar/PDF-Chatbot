\# Chapter 6 Health Insurance Medicare expenditures are expected to grow as a share of GDP because there will be more old people living longer and medical costs keep rising. Proposals for Medicare reform include vouchers, income-related patient cost sharing, and some rationing. Compared to the United States, other economically advanced countries generally have more government involvement in health insurance, finance a larger share of their medical care through taxes, cover more of their population, have more regulation of fees of providers, and have longer wait lists.
