\# Chapter 13 Government Borrowing # Deficits and Debt with Two Components of Government Suppose we divide the government into two components: Social Security (a “government agency”) and the Rest-of-Government. In the year shown, Social Security spends $50 billion and collects $75 billion in tax, while the Rest-of-Government spends $100 billion and collects $25 billion in tax. Social Security runs a $25 billion surplus, and the Rest-of-Government runs a $75 billion deficit, so the government runs a $50 billion deficit. The Rest-of-Government borrows $75 billion—$25 billion from Social Security (which then increases its holding of government bonds by $25 billion) and $50 billion from the public (which then increases its holding of government bonds by $50 billion). Debt held by the public rises by $50 billion, equal to the government deficit of $50 billion. Gross debt of the Rest-of-Government (debt held by the public plus Social Security) rises by $75 billion, equal to the deficit of the Rest-of-Government.

| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Spending           | $50 billion         | $100 billion        | $150 billion        |
| Taxes              | $75 billion         | $25 billion         | $100 billion        |
| Surplus or deficit | $25 billion surplus | $75 billion deficit | $50 billion deficit |

Banks including the U.S. Federal Reserve are counted as part of the public. About 90% of the debt consists of marketable securities—bills, notes, bonds, and inflation-indexed issues called TIPS; the remaining 10% are nonmarketable. The Treasury sells marketable securities in regularly scheduled auctions. Perhaps the most striking fact shown in Table 13.1 is this: Foreign investors (private and governmental) currently hold almost half—about 45%—of U.S. Treasury debt held by the public. The largest foreign investors are China, Japan, and the U.K. (Britain), which together hold over half of foreign-held U.S. Treasury debt and about 25% of the total U.S. Treasury debt held by the public of $5 trillion. U.S. Treasury debt held by U.S. government agencies (roughly $4 trillion) are non-marketable securities. The securities represent credits to the various government agencies that hold them and are redeemed when needed to cover benefit payments or other expenses. More than half of this debt is held by the Social Security Trust Fund. Since the mid-1980s, Social Security has collected more revenue from payroll taxes and... # TABLE 13.1 U.S. Treasury Debt A Breakdown of U.S. Treasury Debt
