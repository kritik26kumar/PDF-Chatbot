\# Questions

1. If workers support retirees, BR = \_\_\_\_\_. Then B/W = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. But L/R has been (rising, falling) because retirees have been living \_\_\_\_\_\_\_; so if t stays constant, B/W will (rise, fall); to keep B/W constant, t must be (raised, lowered).
2. Suppose Social Security begins in period 1 with a payroll tax rate of 20%. The wage grows 20% per period, and the number of workers grows 20% per period. Complete the table.

| Period | Workers | Wage           | Tax/Worker      | Total Taxes     | Retirees       | Benefit         |
| ------ | ------- | -------------- | --------------- | --------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| 1      | 100     | $10,000        | $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | Omit            | Omit           | Omit            |
| 2      | \_\_\_  | $ \_\_\_\_\_\_ | $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ |

3. For a worker who pays T₁ and later receives a benefit B₂, the rate of return is defined as r\* = \_\_\_\_\_\_, so in this table, r\* = \_\_\_\_\_\_%.
4. Starting with r\*’s definition, use algebra to derive a relationship between r\*, gW, and gL.
5. If each generation is self-sufficient, then r\* = mpk because each person uses his saving to buy a \_\_\_\_\_\_ from a firm that buys a $100 \_\_\_\_\_\_ that raises firm revenue $6 per year so the mpk is \_\_% per year and the saver is paid r\* = \_\_\_\_\_\_ %.
6. It is estimated that when workers support retirees, r\* would be \_\_\_\_\_\_ %, and when each generation is self-sufficient, r\* would be \_\_\_\_\_\_ %.
7. “Breaking out is hard to do” because workers must save \_\_\_\_\_\_. Explain.
8. Complete the following table.
