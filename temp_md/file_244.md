\# Chapter 8 Income Taxes is inelastic with respect to the return that the saver receives. Fourth, even if it is true that capital income has already been taxed at the business level, so has labor income through the payroll tax, so taxing the household on its labor income is also double taxation. If capital income is taxed more heavily at the business level than labor income, perhaps it should be taxed more lightly at the household level; but then lighter taxation, not exclusion, would be warranted. # The Payroll Tax The payroll tax that finances Social Security and Medicare is a labor income tax with particular features. The payroll tax is levied on each employee’s wage and salary income. Half the payroll tax is levied on the employer and half on the employee, but the employer is required to send both halves to the government. As explained in Chapter 7 (Figure 7.4), workers bear most of the burden of both halves. For Social Security, the tax is levied on an employee’s annual wage income up to a ceiling ($102,000 in 2008 and is automatically increased each year in line with wage income in the economy) at a tax rate of 6.2% on the employer and 6.2% on the employee for a combined rate of 12.4%. For Medicare, an employee’s entire wage income is taxed (there is no ceiling) at a tax rate of 1.45% on the employer and 1.45% on the employee for a combined rate of 2.9%. Thus, wage income below the ceiling is taxed at a combined rate of 12.4% + 2.9% = 15.3%. The payroll tax for Social Security is regressive. An employee’s wage income is taxed at a combined flat rate of 12.4% up to the ceiling and a 0% rate above the ceiling. Moreover, the payroll tax excludes capital income. As household income rises, the ratio of payroll tax to household income falls for two reasons: the decline in the rate from 12.4% to 0% and the exclusion of capital income, which generally rises as a percentage of household income. The payroll tax for Medicare is also regressive, though less regressive than the payroll tax for Social Security. An employee’s entire wage income is taxed at a combined flat rate of 2.9%. However, the payroll tax excludes capital income, which makes the ratio of payroll tax to household income fall as household income rises. Under the U.S. tax system, therefore, it might be said that labor income is double-taxed: once under the household income tax and once under the payroll tax. What really matters is the total tax rate on labor income. If an employee’s wage income is taxed 15% under the income tax and 15.3% under the payroll tax, then the total tax rate on the employee’s labor income is 30.3%. # Summary The household income tax raises over 40% of all federal revenue—more revenue than any other federal tax. To compute its income tax, a household adds its wage income and investment income (such as interest and dividends) to obtain its total income, makes a few adjustments to obtain its adjusted gross income, subtracts personal exemptions, subtracts either the standard deduction or a set of itemized deductions to obtain its taxable income, applies the tax rates in the tax tables to obtain its tentative tax, and subtracts tax credits to obtain its tax. An affluent household pays whichever is larger: its regular tax or its alternative minimum tax. Different tax schedules apply to married couples and single persons; when two persons marry, some incur a marriage penalty, others enjoy a marriage bonus, and still others are unaffected. A basic justification for the income tax is that it taxes households according to their ability to pay. A household’s total income seems like a better measure of its ability to pay tax than its labor income alone, its capital income alone, or its consumption. If graduated tax rates are utilized, then the household income tax will be progressive: As
