\# Chapter 12 Low–Income Assistance # Appendix # Low-Income Assistance # THE EITC AND LABOR SUPPLY We now use an indifference-curve/budget-line diagram to analyze the effect of the EITC and the NIT (or welfare) on labor supply (review the appendix to Chapter 1 which introduces the indifference-curve/budget-line diagram). We assume that a person gets “utility” (i.e., subjective well-being) from two goods: leisure and income. For each hour that a person works, she earns income but sacrifices an hour of leisure. We assume the person is offered a job with a specific wage but is given a choice about how many hours to work per year—that is, how many hours of labor to supply per year. The person can vary her annual hours of labor supply by varying her hours per day, her days of work per week, and/or her vacations. Of course, employers usually do not give an employee completely free choice over the number of hours—but many employers do give some choice. Figure 12A.1 shows the indifference-curve/budget-line diagram for the EITC. Leisure hours are plotted horizontally, and income is plotted vertically. With 365 days in a year and 24 hours in a day, there are 8,760 hours in a year. We define any hour that the person is not working in the marketplace to be an hour of leisure (so leisure includes time sleeping, caring for children, doing home chores or repairs, etc.). As shown in the diagram, the maximum possible hours of leisure per year is 8,760 hours, so point M is a point on the person’s budget line (a point she could choose). Suppose the wage she is offered is $10 an hour. Starting from point M with 8,760 hours of leisure and no income, for every hour of leisure she gives up to work she moves up $10 if there is no EITC. The slope of her budget line MN without the EITC is –$10, and she chooses point O with 8,260 hours of leisure per year, so she works 500 hours per year and earns $5,000 of income (note that a person working 40 hours per week for 50 weeks works 2,000 hours per year). # FIGURE 12A.1 The EITC and Work
