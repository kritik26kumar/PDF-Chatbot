In considering possible reforms of Social Security, it is important to take account of the fact that many individuals will be preparing for retirement privately as well as through Social Security, while some individuals—either by choice or because they can’t afford it—will be preparing only through Social Security. Individuals who are also preparing privately will be accumulating funds in individual investment accounts—funds they own and control but that are subject to investment (stock market) risk. Individuals who are not preparing privately will not accumulate any funds in an individual investment account unless such accounts are established as part of Social Security. Table 5.3 summarizes the points we have made in this chapter, comparing a collective workers-support-retirees system and an individual self-sufficient system for Social Security. # THE U.S. SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM # Background Social Security was enacted in the United States in 1935 as the crowning jewel of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal. The original plan was for workers (and their employers) to pay payroll taxes (a percentage of wage income up to a ceiling), have one large Social Security fund build up, and upon retirement receive benefits from the single large fund that they had helped to build. In Table 5.1, the original plan was the southeast entry: Each generation collectively would be self-sufficient in providing for its own retirement. In the late 1930s, payroll taxes were paid, the single fund began to build up, and few benefits were paid out because few retirees had paid into the fund while they were working—according to the original plan, they were therefore not eligible for benefits. However, there was a lot of sympathy for the retirees of the late 1930s. The Great Depression had forced many of them to use up their savings when they became
