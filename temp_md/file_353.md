\# 332 Public Finance The CBO’s long-term budget outlook presents a challenge for the public. The analysis in this chapter suggests that simply accepting a rise in the deficit to 8% of GDP would pose serious risks and burdens on future taxpayers. But to avoid it, either projected spending growth on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security must be significantly reduced or tax revenue as a percentage of GDP must be significantly increased. Hard choices lie ahead. # Summary The commonsense concern about excessive borrowing for an individual or a business firm also applies to government. Any borrower, including a government, must rely on creditors who will exact a price—interest payments—for their service. Borrowing today means repayments to creditors tomorrow. If the government is unable to make repayments when they come due, it will default, and creditors will go unpaid; thereafter the government may find it difficult to borrow even in an emergency. Government borrowing shifts the burden of today’s government spending from today’s taxpayers to tomorrow’s taxpayers. If the government borrows by selling bonds, the government must pay interest to bondholders. To pay the interest, future taxpayers must pay additional taxes. Taxpayers at the time the government borrows are better off, but future taxpayers are worse off. Because today’s capital expenditures (e.g., highways, schools) primarily benefit tomorrow’s taxpayers, it is appropriate to shift some of the burden to future taxpayers by borrowing. However, politicians may try to classify any expenditure they favor as a “capital” expenditure—an investment—that can be financed by borrowing rather than taxation. To avoid undermining the discipline of politicians, it may be better to simply prescribe that government expenditure (with perhaps a few exceptions) must be financed by taxation rather than borrowing. If the government borrows, the interest rate is bid up, causing business firms to reduce their borrowing and investment; thus, government borrowing “crowds out” investment, thereby reducing tomorrow’s private capital stock and output per worker (i.e., productivity). A balanced budget rule would impose desirable discipline on politicians because, if they must levy taxes to finance government spending programs, they will weigh cost against benefit. But an always balanced budget rule would be risky: It could force the government to take action in the middle of a recession—either cutting spending or raising taxes—that would make the recession worse. Instead, many economists advocate a particular kind of balanced budget rule that would not make a recession worse—the full employment balanced budget rule (FEBAR). A normal unemployment balanced budget rule (NUBAR) is a slight modification of FEBAR. Under NUBAR, each year Congress must enact a planned budget for the coming fiscal year that technicians estimate would be balanced if next year the unemployment rate is normal (the average of the preceding decade). A government’s fiscal imbalance is a better measure of its financial future than its explicit debt. Under Social Security and Medicare, the federal government has scheduled cash benefits for retired workers, determined by a formula, as well as payment of their medical bills. These scheduled benefits are much larger than the tax revenue that it is estimated will be raised by current payroll tax rates (given projected ceilings on taxable payroll). This gap between scheduled benefits and assigned taxes is called the fiscal imbalance of each program. Generational accounting illuminates how different generations (or age cohorts) are treated by government. Some generations may pay more in taxes than they receive.
