\# 88 Public Finance differently about whether the death that is avoided by the project would have been from a highway accident, drowning, burning, bombing, shooting, and so forth, and they might be willing to pay different dollar amounts to reduce the chance of particular kinds of death. # Mistakes to Avoid Supporters of proposed projects are naturally tempted to overestimate benefits. Objective analysts should be on guard to avoid several mistakes. We consider each in turn. # Counting Job Creation as a Benefit How often have you heard a politician defend a government spending project by saying it will “create jobs”? This assertion implies that a cost-benefit evaluation of a project should count as a benefit the jobs created. But it shouldn’t. Why not? Because the issue is whether to create jobs in the project being evaluated or let jobs be created elsewhere in the local economy. Hence, labor used in the project should be counted as a cost, not a benefit. # Double Counting the Same Benefit Building a highway reduces commuter time which causes the value of suburban homes to rise. The value of time saved should be counted as a benefit, but it would be double counting to add the rise in value of the suburban homes. # Counting Secondary Benefits Benefits should be measured as the amount that direct users of the project would be willing to pay for its use. For example, the benefit of a highway is the amount drivers would be willing to pay in tolls to use it. The demands of all drivers—individuals and employees of companies—should be counted. What shouldn’t be counted are indirect secondary benefits to individuals and business firms that do not use the highway. # REDUCING GLOBAL WARMING Cost-benefit analysis can also be applied to a broader issue like global warming. How much should each country cut back on its emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide in an effort to combat global warming? Cutting back is costly—carbon fuel combustion must be reduced, thereby reducing driving and goods that are produced using fuel. Assume such a cutback is likely to reduce global warming in the future. Such a reduction in warming would benefit many (though not all) countries. Cutting back should occur as long as the marginal cost of further cutback is less than the marginal benefit of further reduction in future warming. Suppose a carbon tax is the method used to induce the cutback. If the tax is $50 per ton, then it will be profitable for fuel producers to cut back as long as the marginal cost of cutback is less than $50 and to stop when the marginal cost reaches $50. This must be compared to the marginal benefit resulting from that last unit of cutback. If the marginal benefit is greater than $50, then the tax should be raised to induce more cutback. The tax should be adjusted until the marginal cost equals the marginal benefit. The benefit occurs in the future when there would be less warming as a consequence of less emission today. Suppose it is estimated that the additional future warming from another ton emitted today would reduce crops by $X, raise air-conditioning by $Y, and flood coastal property worth $Z. If these total $50, current cutback is optimal; if they
