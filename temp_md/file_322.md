\# Chapter 12 Low–Income Assistance whom the child is living) should file for the EITC. Efforts have been made to reduce the “overparticipation” rate. A helpful measure has been the requirement that each child must be identified by a Social Security number. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 included provisions that deny the EITC for a decade to taxpayers who fraudulently claim the EITC and impose “due diligence” requirements on paid preparers of tax returns involving the EITC. # The Marginal Tax Rate Generated by the Phasedown of the EITC Whenever any government benefit phases down as a person earns additional income, the phasedown reduces the person’s net gain from earning additional income. For example, suppose that when a person earns an additional $100, the government benefit is reduced $20. Then the person’s net gain from earning the additional $100 is $80. It is as though the person were being taxed 20% on the additional earnings. Economists therefore describe this situation by saying the person faces a marginal tax rate of 20%. Of course, the person is not actually being taxed. The person is not making a payment to the government; the government is making a payment to the person; and the person is better off because of the program. The marginal tax rate, however, does tell how much a person gains by earning another $100. If the phase-down rate (the marginal tax rate) is 20%, then the person gains $80 by earning another $100. Thus, a high marginal tax rate may discourage individuals from making the effort to earn more. Even if they do earn more, they may be discouraged because their net gain is less than their additional earnings. # The EITC versus the Negative Income Tax It is important to clarify the relationship between the EITC and the negative income tax (NIT). The NIT was proposed several decades ago and is often mentioned in textbooks, but it has never been enacted. Like the EITC, the NIT would deliver cash benefits to low-income households through the personal income tax filing and refund process. For this reason, some have called the EITC a version of the NIT. However, the NIT, as it was originally proposed, is fundamentally different from the EITC, because the NIT has the same benefit schedule and diagram as welfare except for the flat range: When income is zero, the NIT is at its maximum; as soon as income increases, the NIT benefit is phased down. Hence, the EITC is a work bonus, but the NIT, like welfare, is not because it gives its maximum benefit to a household that doesn’t work and has no income. The NIT lacks a phase-in range that encourages and rewards work. The NIT can be described in two equivalent ways. First, the NIT gives a household a benefit equal to a percentage of the gap between the household’s income and a target income. For example, the NIT might give a household a benefit equal to 75% of the gap between its income and $8,000. If a household’s income is $0, its benefit is $6,000, but if its income increases to $4,000, its benefit is only $3,000. Note that earning $4,000 raises the amount it can spend only $1,000 (from $6,000 to $7,000), so this NIT imposes a marginal tax rate of 75%. Second, the NIT gives the household the maximum benefit if its income is zero but reduces the benefit as the household earns income. For example, the NIT might give the household a benefit of $6,000 if its income is zero but would reduce the benefit. 2 The impact of the EITC and the NIT on labor supply is shown in the appendix to this chapter, using an indifference-curve/budget-line diagram.
