\# Chapter 11 Education The variable matching grant plan has two advantages over the district power equalizing plan. First, each school district would be told its matching rate m, so it can easily see that it would receive m state dollars for each dollar that it raises itself for education. Second, the state would explicitly choose how much it wants to vary the matching rate as property per pupil varies across school districts; if the current degree of variation in matching rates does not reduce inequality as much as the state desires, the state could adjust its formula to explicitly increase the degree of variation of matching rates. # State versus Local Funding of Public Schools States on average provide about 50% of the revenue spent by local public schools, but the state share varies widely. Local governments on average provide a bit more than 40%, and the federal government on average provides a bit less than 10%. What should make a citizen favor a high or low state percentage? State government can redistribute funds from high- to low-income districts. A citizen who supports such redistribution should favor a high state percentage, whereas a citizen who opposes such redistribution should favor a low state percentage. The larger the state percentage, the more likely the state will impose regulations. Local districts will probably retain greater control over the curriculum in their schools if the state percentage is low. A state matching grant reduces the price of education to the local school district below its cost; the larger the state’s matching rate, the lower the price the local school district faces. If a district’s matching rate is 2, it must raise only $10 to obtain $30 of education because the state will match its $10 with $20. If there were no positive externality, this would induce the local school district to spend too much on education. If there is a positive externality—if others outside the school district benefit from the district’s education spending—then a state subsidy via a matching grant is exactly what is needed to induce the district to spend optimally. Suppose many affluent suburbanites want low-income children to receive higher education spending per pupil than the low-income district could afford on its own. Then there is a positive externality, so a subsidy equal to the external benefit induces a socially optimal expansion. # Improving Public Schools Many approaches have been taken to try to improve the performance of public schools. Here we consider two of them: paying teachers for performance and holding schools accountable for results. # Paying Teachers for Performance Throughout most of the U.S. economy, efficiency is promoted by paying workers according to job performance and discharging workers who perform poorly. Workers are motivated to work hard and perform well when they are paid more, and they fear discharge if they slack off. Yet in some sectors of the economy, workers are paid by seniority and are protected against being discharged. Studies and common sense suggest that efficiency suffers when pay doesn’t depend on performance and when workers can’t be discharged for bad performance. Some workers and unions, however, understandably prefer pay by seniority and protection against discharge. Private sector employers who face intense pressure from competition and who fear that customers will switch to more efficient rivals usually insist on retaining the ability to vary pay with performance and discharge slacking workers. When employers are subject to less competitive pressure, however, they sometimes give up this ability.
