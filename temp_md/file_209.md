\# 188 Public Finance the efficiency loss from low-income people, but increases the efficiency loss from high-income people. The revenue-rate curve has a peak (maximum) for tax revenue at a tax rate *tₘ* that is less than 100%; hence, the tax rate should be set somewhere between 0 and *tₘ*. Most economists (but not supply-siders like Laffer) estimate that *tₘ* is probably higher than the current tax rate for most U.S. taxes; this implies that, starting from the current tax rate, raising the rate would increase tax revenue and cutting the rate would reduce tax revenue.
