\# Acknowledgments I give thanks to my superb editors at McGraw-Hill, Noelle Fox and Karen Fisher, for their detailed recommendations on the substance and style of every chapter, paragraph, and sentence. I also thank McGraw-Hill project manager Kathryn Mikulic for coordinating the production process. I owe a debt to my exceptional economics graduate student assistant at the University of Delaware, Drew Sawyer, for his meticulous checking of all substantive details in the entire book. I am grateful to my public finance students at the University of Delaware who gave me detailed feedback on draft chapters of my book over the past few semesters. I thank my two colleagues at the University of Delaware, Ken Lewis and Saul Hoffman, for our joint research over the years that prepared me to write this book. I am grateful to Karen Gebhardt at the University of Colorado for her work on the PowerPoint presentations. I owe thanks to the many public finance economists whose writings have educated me. Finally, I am grateful to my wife Ann, my son Jesse, and my daughter Suzanna.
