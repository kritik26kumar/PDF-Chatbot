\# Chapter 7 Tax Incidence and Inefficiency # FIGURE 7.1 (a) The supply curve shifts up and most of the burden is born by buyers. (b) The supply curve shifts up and most of the burden is born by sellers. (c) The demand curve shifts down and the distribution of the burden is exactly the same as in Figure 7.1(a) (most of the burden is born by buyers). (d) The tax wedge shows the distribution of the tax burden between buyers and sellers.

(c) A tax on buyers when demand is relatively inelastic (d) The tax wedge shortcut $4.30 per gallon, and the quantity demanded would fall from 100 to 90 gallons. Note also that the tax revenue equals the area of the rectangle with the base 90 and the height $1.00, so the tax revenue equals $90. Who bears the burden of the $1.00 per gallon tax? Without the tax, drivers would have paid $3.50 per gallon. With the tax, they pay $4.30. So drivers bear a burden of $0.80 per gallon. Without the tax, station operators would have received and kept $3.50 per gallon. With the tax, they receive $4.30 per gallon from the drivers but must pay $1.00 per gallon to the government, so they keep $3.30 per gallon. Hence, suppliers bear a burden of $0.20 per gallon. As drawn in Figure 7.1(a), the burden of the $1.00 per gallon tax is split 80/20 between demanders (drivers) and suppliers (station operators).
