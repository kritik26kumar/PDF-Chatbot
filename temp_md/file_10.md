\# In The News # The 2007 Minneapolis Interstate Highway Bridge Collapse On August 1, 2007, the interstate highway bridge over the Mississippi River at Minneapolis, Minnesota, collapsed, killing 13, injuring 80, and stranding many cars precariously over the river. The shock of the collapse reverberated around the country. Many claimed that the collapse shows that U.S. bridges and highways (infrastructure) are inadequately maintained and inadequately inspected. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that roughly a quarter of U.S. bridges are “structurally deficient or functionally obsolete” and calls for a very large federal expenditure to remedy the deficiency. There is a socially optimal amount of maintenance and inspection—the amount at which the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost. Thus, a bridge collapse is tragic for its victims but in itself does not tell us whether maintenance and inspection have been socially optimal. To decide this question, there is no substitute for estimating the dollar cost of additional maintenance and inspection and comparing it to an estimate of the dollar benefit from reducing the probability that a collapse will occur. # Case Study # A Carbon Tax versus a Carbon Cap and Trade Program At a conference in Washington, D.C., in October 2007 hosted by the Hamilton Project of the Brookings Institution, two economists presented papers advocating two different carbon price policies for reducing carbon emissions in the United States. Professor Robert Stavins of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government advocated a carbon cap and trade program, and Professor Gilbert Metcalf of Tufts University, a carbon tax. Before discussing their differences, it is important to emphasize that they both agree about the following points: (1) either carbon price policy would be much better than command and control technology regulations; (2) a carbon price policy should raise revenue so that other taxes can be reduced (Stavins therefore proposes that initially half, and eventually all, the permits be auctioned by the government rather than given free to firms); (3) to simplify practical administration the carbon price should be imposed upstream; (4) cap and trade is more certain to hit the pollution reduction target than a tax—this fact appeals to environmentalists; (5) the European Union countries are adopting cap and trade so harmonization will be easier if the United States does too. Metcalf makes these arguments for preferring a tax to cap-and-trade. First, historically cap and trade programs have given permits out for free and not collected revenue that can be used to reduce other taxes. Second, there will be wasteful political lobbying by firms for free permits. Third, the administration of a tax is time-tested, whereas administering cap and trade is a new challenge. # Current Research # Should Some Medical Care Be Rationed? In their 2005 book, *Can We Say No? The Challenge of Rationing Health Care* (Brookings Institution Press), economist Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution and physician William Schwartz contend that the United States will either have to deny some medical care to some people who would obtain some benefit from the care or to accept a significant slowdown in the improvement of our nonmedical standard of care that is worth less than it costs to people who are well insured—that is, to ration care. Aaron and Schwartz concede that rationing care is painful (their 1984 book called rationing “the painful prescription”) and that “the steps necessary to ration health care may prove more objectionable than the cost of paying for it.” They write that “health care can be rationed efficiently or inefficiently,” and argue that it seems likely that the numerical values that Congress chooses for Social Security’s EEA and FBA have an important impact on the age workers choose to retire. # Real-World Issues International evidence strongly supports the link between Social Security and retirement; similar spikes are generally observed in other countries. In France and the Netherlands, social security’s EEA is 60, and there is no increase in the starting benefit if a worker delays retiring beyond age 60; not surprisingly, the percentage of workers retiring in each country has a huge spike at age 60. In the early 1970s Germany reduced its social security EEA by five years, and during the next decade the average age at which German workers retired also fell by about five years. # REFORMING SOCIAL SECURITY The debate over reforming Social Security has been intense during the past decade. Both President Clinton, a Democrat, and President George W. Bush, a Republican, warned the nation that substantial legislative action must be taken by Congress to protect Social Security for the next generation. The two presidents disagreed about what problems like global warming and the Social Security shortfall.
