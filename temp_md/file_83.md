\# 62 Public Finance Assume that the marginal cost (MC) of each additional foot of thickness stays constant as the wall gets thicker and that the construction crew charges a price per foot P equal to this MC because there is competition from other construction ships that might visit the island. Now consider the numbers in Figure 3.1. A 1-foot-thick wall costs $600 to build, and each additional foot of thickness costs $600, so the MC line is horizontal at a height of $600. It just so happens that the heights of the MB curves (which happen to be straight lines for these families) are in the ratio of 3:2:1; at any level of thickness, the ratio MBH: MBM: MBL is 3:2:1. For example, at a thickness of 10 feet, MBH = $300, MBM = $200, and MBL = $100. It will prove useful to draw a sum of the MBs curve (ΣMB, where the symbol Σ means “sum”) above the three family MB curves to indicate the vertical sum of the MB curves of the three families. For example, at a thickness of 10 feet, ΣMB = $600 ($300 + $200 + $100); while at a thickness of 0 feet, ΣMB = $900 ($450 + $300 + $150). The reason for summing the MBs of all three families is that protection from the wall is nonrival—each family’s protection does not diminish the others—so when the wall is made a foot thicker, the total marginal benefit for the three families is the sum of the MBs of each family. By contrast, with a private good for which consumption is rival, only the MB of the person who consumes the good matters (everyone else has no benefit). Hence, for a public good, we care about the ΣMB of all who simultaneously consume it, while for a private good we care only about the MB of the one person who consumes it. Then it would be best if the three families choose the 10-foot-thick wall, the thickness at which the ΣMB curve intersects the MC curve. Why? Look at Figure 3.1 and suppose they choose a wall thinner than 10 feet—for example, 8 feet. This would be a mistake, because it would be possible to make everyone better off by making the wall thicker. How? Starting from 8 feet, suppose they incur the $600 cost of making the wall a foot thicker and divide the cost so that H pays $300, M $200, and L $100. From the diagram, at 8 feet, each family’s MB would be greater than its cost-share (its share of the cost), so all would gain if the wall were thickened from 8 to 9 feet; the same would be true from 9 to 10 feet. Symmetrically, look at Figure 3.1 and suppose the families choose a wall thicker than 10 feet—for example, 12 feet. This also would be a mistake because it would be possible to make everyone better off by choosing a thinner wall. How? Starting from 12 feet, suppose they save the $600 cost by making the wall a foot thinner and then divide the saving, so that H saves $300, M $200, and L $100. From the diagram, at 12 feet, the MB that each family gives up would be less than its cost saving, so it would be better off thinning the wall from 12 feet to 11 feet; the same would be true from 11 feet to 10 feet. If they choose 10 feet, it would not be possible to make everyone better off by making the wall either thicker or thinner. Starting from a particular situation, suppose it would be impossible to make a change that makes everyone better off. Then economists call the situation “Pareto optimal,” or efficient. Starting from a particular situation, suppose it would be possible to make a change that makes everyone better off. Then economists call the situation “not Pareto optimal,” or inefficient. So 10 feet is the socially optimal (efficient) thickness of the wall. Starting from 10 feet, it would be impossible to make a change (say, to 9 or 11 feet) that would make.
