Area of the triangle BAD. The tax prevents this net gain, BAD, from taking place, so the area of the BAD triangle equals the inefficiency (deadweight loss) from the tax. In this example, the inefficiency is $20 because the area of a triangle equals ½ (base ⫻ height) ⫽ ½ ($4 ⫻ 10). Note that if MB and MC were curves rather than straight lines, then BAD would be a “triangle” with two sides curved rather than straight so that the formula for the area, ½ (base ⫻ height), would be an approximation. Throughout this book, we simplify by assuming that BAD is a triangle with three straight sides so that the formula gives its exact area. Symmetrically, a subsidy given by the government causes an increase in the quantity above the optimal quantity. Figure 1.5 shows the effect of a $4 per unit subsidy given to producers. Figure 1.6 shows the effect of a $4 per unit subsidy given to consumers. Let’s explain each in turn. # FIGURE 1.5 A Subsidy to Producers
