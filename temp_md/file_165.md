\# FEATURES OF HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS Let’s now examine several distinctive features of health insurance markets that we need to grasp before we can consider the role that government might play in health insurance. # Patients, Doctors, and the Principal-Agent Problem The patient often doesn’t know which medical care option would be best. Hence, she must rely on her physician for advice and help in decision making. The patient (the principal) hires the doctor to act as her agent—an expert on whom the patient relies. The problem is that the doctor’s motivations may not always coincide with the patient’s. After all, a doctor’s earnings are affected by her decisions. Hence, the patient-doctor relationship presents a principal-agent problem. To simplify, there are two opposite risks for the patient. Suppose that the more service a doctor provides, the more the doctor is paid. This is called fee for service (FFS). Under FFS, there is a risk that the doctor will advise her patients to accept more service than would really be best for them. On the other hand, suppose the doctor is prepaid a fixed sum for the patient for the year, regardless of how much service is provided. This is called capitation. Under capitation, there is a risk that the doctor will advise patients to accept less service than would really be best for the patients. Medical provider organizations that charge capitation have been called health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Thus, with FFS there is a risk that doctors will do too much, but with an HMO there is a risk that doctors will do too little. Each patient will have a different preference.
