\# Chapter 3 Public Goods and Political Economy # Why Does an Individual Citizen Vote? Let’s raise a basic question: Why does an individual citizen bother to vote? After all, a citizen might reason: “My vote has virtually no chance of deciding the election, and I have other things to do with my time.” Many citizens do reason this way and don’t bother to vote. But many citizens do vote despite recognizing that their own vote won’t decide the election. Why do they do it? Among the reasons are the following:

* Many citizens believe that if most citizens decided not to vote, democracy would fail and society would be worse off. Consequently, these citizens believe it is their duty to set an example and do not voting is not doing their civic duty—it’s free riding.
* Many citizens like to officially express their preferences about who should hold political office and what policies they favor or oppose. In economist’s language, these citizens receive utility (satisfaction) from voting that outweighs its time cost, even when they know it won’t affect the outcome of the election.
* Many citizens fear that others will think badly of them if they don’t vote.

Because of these and other influences, we observe a variety of patterns in elections. In some, candidates of both parties take positions close to the middle of the entire electorate. In other elections, candidates of both parties stick to positions close to the middle of their own party and stay quite a distance away from the middle of the entire electorate. # Logrolling Instead of legislators voting on one issue at a time, issues can be packaged, and this can make a difference to the outcome when legislators differ with respect to intensity of preference. Suppose representative Hawk is strongly in favor of high defense spending but weakly opposed to spending for national parks, while representative Nature is strongly in favor of spending for national parks but only weakly opposed to high defense spending. If the issues are voted on separately, Hawk and Nature cancel each other’s votes: Hawk votes for high defense spending and Nature votes against it, while Nature votes for high national park spending and Hawk votes against it. If more than half the votes are required for passage, then neither passes. To break the deadlock, Hawk and Nature make a deal: Each agrees to vote for the other’s priority. Then both pass. Hawk is willing to accept a small loss from high national park spending to get a large gain from high defense spending, and Nature is willing to accept a small loss from high defense spending to get a large gain from high national park spending. To break a deadlock (where nothing passes), they have agreed to trade votes and engage in logrolling: “I’ll vote for your highest priority if you’ll vote for mine.” The logrolling can be accomplished through one bill and one vote or two bills and two votes. Under the one-bill approach, a bill containing high defense spending and high national park spending is put to a vote, and both Hawk and Nature vote for it. Under the two-bill approach, both vote for the first bill authorizing high defense spending, and then both vote for the second bill authorizing high national park spending. It might seem that logrolling benefits both legislators and their constituents (if their constituents have the same priorities) and should, therefore, be viewed positively. Yet logrolling is often viewed negatively. Why?
