\# Chapter 5 # Social Security that they do not have to save as much as they would have if there were no Social Security program. If there is no reform, Social Security will face a serious problem around 2040 when the bonds in the Trust Fund have been drawn down to zero and payroll tax revenue is projected to be about 70% of scheduled benefits; either benefits will be cut from $100 to $70 (an abrupt 30% cut), or taxes will be raised from $70 to $100, or the difference will be split at $85. To avoid facing these options in 2040, payroll tax growth has to be raised and benefit growth slowed, as soon as possible. A more fundamental change would be to gradually shift Social Security from a workers-support-retirees system to an each-generation-self-sufficient system. Whether this is done collectively (with a larger buildup of bonds in the Trust Fund) or individually (with the establishment of individual investment accounts), during the transition, workers would need to double-save and continue to support retirees while saving for their own retirement.
