\# Chapter 5 # Social Security Fortunately, computer programmers have written a rate of return computer program that will perform the repeated trial-and-error process in a split second. If you have access to a rate of return computer program, all you have to do is enter the 40 numbers for your 40 tax payments and the 20 numbers for your 20 benefits, press a button, and you’ll see the numerical value of your r\*—the value that makes the left side (the present value of your taxes) equal the right side (the present value of your benefits). Finally, here’s the general formula. If you work until year R (from year 1 to year R) and are retired from year R + 1 to year J, then your rate of return is the numerical value for r\* that makes R T J B ∑\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ∑\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ i i 1 (1 + r\*)ⁱ R 1(1 + r\*)i In our example, R was 40 and J, 60. The rate of return computer program is ready to handle any numerical value of R and J.
