\# Questions

1. What determines how much burden consumers bear from a tax on the sellers of good X? Draw and refer to two diagrams in your explanation.
2. Suppose the price of gasoline that drivers pay at the pump is $4 and stations pay a tax of $1 to the government and keep $3. Draw a diagram to show this. Then there is a tax switch: The tax on stations is ended, and drivers are required to keep receipts and pay the government a $1 tax for each gallon they consume. On the same diagram, show what happens to the pump price. What is the impact of the switch on drivers? On stations?
3. With a 7% sales tax, the consumer buys an item for $100 and pays $107 at the cash register. How much burden does the 7% sales tax impose on the consumer? Draw a diagram and refer to it in your explanation.
4. Suppose a worker’s two-week paycheck states that his gross wage income was $1,000. How much will he see has been taken out for Social Security? How much has his employer also contributed to Social Security? How much burden has the payroll tax imposed on him? Draw a diagram, put numbers on it, and refer to it in your explanation.
5. How elastic is the supply of labor?
6. How elastic is the supply of saving?
7. Using two diagrams, explain how a tax on capital income burdens workers.
8. Using two diagrams, explain how a tax on high-skilled labor burdens low-skilled workers.
9. Consider a tax of $T per unit on good X. With two diagrams show how the efficiency loss from the tax varies with the elasticities.
10. If a tax is doubled, the efficiency loss is \_\_ times as great. Explain with a diagram.
11. Using a diagram, explain the efficiency loss from a tax on labor income.
12. Using a diagram, explain the efficiency loss from a tax on capital income.
13. Draw and explain the revenue-rate curve, and comment on Laffer’s hypothesis.
14. Derive the formulas L ½t²eWH and L/R ½te. Explain your derivation.
15. Appendix questions:
1. Draw an indifference-curve/budget-line diagram to show the effect of removing a wage tax on labor supply. Directly below, draw another diagram that shows the ordinary labor supply curve and the compensated labor supply curve. Explain.
2. Draw an indifference-curve/budget-line diagram to show the effect of removing a tax on interest income on saving. Directly below, draw another diagram that shows the ordinary saving supply curve and the compensated saving supply curve. Explain.
