\# Questions

1. Suppose a factory would be built in one year (year 0) and last only a year (year 1). The construction cost in year 0 would be $100,000 financed by borrowing and the profit in year 1 would be $120,000. Should the firm build the factory? Explain why or why not.

2. Suppose the factory lasts two years instead of one, and the profit is $60,000 in year 1 and $72,000 in year 2. Should it be built? Explain.

3. For a new highway, how would you calculate the benefit to firms that transport their cargo by truck?

4. One way to estimate the benefit of a new highway is increased output. Explain.

5. Another way to estimate the benefit of a new highway is to measure how suburban home prices vary by commuting time from the city. Explain.

6. Still another way to estimate the benefit of a new highway is to ask hypothetical questions to drivers. Explain.

7. If a highway is made safer, the benefit is fewer deaths and injuries. Explain the following two ways that economists put a dollar value on fewer deaths and injuries:

1. revealed preference
2. contingent valuation

8. Give three mistakes that the cost-benefit analyst should avoid.

9. How does the social discount rate affect cost-benefit analysis for global warming?

10. How can contingent valuation help answer: “Should Medicare pay for treatment X?”

11. Discuss the costs of the Iraq War since 2003.

12. Go online to read about the controversy over putting a dollar value on a life saved in cost-benefit analysis. Write about your opinions on VSL.

13. Go online to find an example of cost-benefit analysis not discussed in this chapter. Explain how this analysis was used to reach a final decision.
