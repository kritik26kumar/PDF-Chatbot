\# Questions Questions 1 to 7 concern a different wall on a different island with families A, B, and C.

1. The ratio MBA:MBB:MBC is 5:2:1 at any thickness. For example, at a thickness of 0 feet, MBA = $1,000, MBB = $400, MBC = $200, and at a thickness of 5 feet, MBA = $500, MBB = $200, MBC = $100. The marginal cost (MC) of building an additional foot of thickness is $800. Draw the diagram, label the curves (lines), and show numbers.
2. Would it be socially optimal to increase wall thickness above 0 feet? Would it be socially optimal to decrease wall thickness below 10 feet? Explain why or why not.
3. Suppose A, B, and C are taxed the same dollar amount ($\_\_\_\_\_\_ per foot). Then A would prefer (more, less) than 5 feet, while C would prefer (more, less) than 5 feet.
4. A, B, and C would all prefer 5 feet if their taxes are $\_\_\_\_\_\_, $\_\_\_\_\_\_, and $\_\_\_\_\_\_ per foot.
5. In questions 5 to 7, “optimal tax” means the tax that induces all families to prefer the socially optimal thickness.
6. Suppose A’s income is 5 times C’s income. Then the optimal tax to finance the wall is (progressive, proportional, regressive), because A has 5 times as much income as C and pays \_\_\_\_\_\_ times as much tax.
7. Suppose A’s income is 3 times C’s. Then the optimal tax to finance the wall is (progressive, proportional, regressive), because A has 3 times as much income as C and pays \_\_\_\_\_\_ times as much tax.
8. Suppose A’s income is 7 times C’s. Then the optimal tax to finance the wall is (progressive, proportional, regressive), because A has 7 times as much income as C and pays \_\_\_\_\_\_ times as much tax.

Questions 8 and 9 concern voting. The preferences are shown in the table. Each family (H, M, L, and D) votes between two choices (such as thick and thin) and then between two other choices.

| Choice | H            | M            | L            | D            |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| First  | Thick        | Intermediate | Thin         | Thin         |
| Second | Intermediate | Thin         | Intermediate | Thick        |
| Third  | Thin         | Thick        | Thick        | Intermediate |

8. With H, M, and L voting, but not D, what happens? Why?
