Move one column to the right to see average after-tax income—average income after subtracting the burden of federal taxes. For the bottom quintile the average after-tax income is $15,300 compared to pretax income of $15,900; for the top quintile, the average after-tax income is $172,200 compared to pretax income of $231,300 (and for the top 1%, the average after-tax income is $1,071,500 compared to pretax income of $1,558,500). The rest of Table 9.4 gives the effective tax rate—the tax burden that the household bears as a percentage of its income. For all federal taxes the effective tax rate rises from 4.3% for the bottom quintile to 25.5% for the top quintile and to 31.2% for the top 1%; thus, the federal tax system is progressive. For individual income taxes, the effective tax rate rises from 6.5% for the bottom quintile (because many low-income people, instead of paying income tax, receive the Earned Income Tax Credit by filing their income tax return) to 14.1% for the top quintile and to 19.4% for the top 1%; thus, the federal individual income tax is highly progressive. For corporate income taxes, the effective rate rises from 0.4% for the bottom quintile to 4.9% for the top quintile and to 9.9% for the top 1%; thus, the federal corporate income tax is highly progressive. By contrast, for social insurance payroll taxes, the effective tax rate is 8.3% for the bottom quintile but 6.0% for the top quintile and only 1.7% for the top 1%; thus, the social insurance payroll tax is regressive. Similarly, for excise taxes, the effective tax rate falls from 2.1% for the bottom quintile to 0.5% for the top quintile and to 0.2% for the top 1%; thus, federal excise taxes are regressive. In Table 9.5, look at the left column—Share of Income, Pretax. The bottom 20% of households receive 4.0% of the nation’s pretax income, the top 20% of households receive 55.1% of the nation’s pretax income, and the top 1% of households receive 18.1% of the nation’s pretax income. Move one column to the right—Share of Income, After-Tax—the share of income after subtracting the burden from federal taxes. The top 20% of households receive 51.6% of the nation’s after-tax income (compared to 55.1% of the nation’s pretax income). A comparison of these two columns—the shares of the nation’s pretax and after-tax income—for all income classes shows that the federal tax system makes the distribution of the nation’s after-tax income less unequal than the distribution of the nation’s pretax income.
