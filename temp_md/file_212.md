\# Chapter 7 Tax Incidence and Inefficiency

\# FIGURE 7A.1 # Taxes and Labor Supply If a wage tax is removed, the person moves from A to B if there is no compensation and to s if there is compensation.

|                           | $30,000 | B    | s    |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ---- | ---- |
|                           | $24,000 | A    |      |
| After-tax income          | 200     | 2000 | M    |
|                           | 6560    | 6760 | 8760 |
| Hours of leisure per year | (a)     |      |      |
|                           | $15     | B    | s    |
|                           | $12     | A    |      |
| After-tax wage            | 200     | 2000 | 2200 |

of leisure—his hours remain 6,760—so his annual hours of work remain 2,000; but with the after-tax wage $15 instead of $12, his after-tax income at point B is $30,000 (instead of $24,000 at A). When the person moves from point A to point B, his utility increases because he reaches a higher indifference curve. Figure 7A.1(b) shows what happens to this person’s labor supply when the tax is removed and the after-tax wage rises from $12 to $15. In this figure \[in contrast to Figure 7A.1(a)], annual hours of labor (not leisure) are plotted horizontally, and the after-tax wage (not after-tax income) is plotted vertically. The person’s labor supply remains at 2,000. Thus, the person’s ordinary labor supply curve (Sord) is vertical.
