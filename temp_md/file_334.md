\# Chapter 12 Low–Income Assistance Figure 12A.2); as soon as she earns income, the NIT is phased down (the NIT is similar to welfare except that welfare usually has a flat range before the phasedown begins; neither the NIT nor welfare have a phase-in range, in contrast to the EITC). With the NIT the person’s budget line is FD, which is flatter than MN due to the NIT phasedown. In response to the NIT, this person chooses point F—zero hours of work and an income equal to the NIT $5,000. The flatter the NIT budget line (the higher the phase-out rate—the marginal tax rate), the more likely she will choose point F directly above M and work zero hours. The steeper the NIT budget line (the lower the phase-out rate—the marginal tax rate), the more likely she will choose a point F⬘ (not shown) to the left of point M on a higher indifference curve than point F and therefore she will choose some hours of work; the point F⬘ that she chooses would still lie to the right of point O, so that she would work less under the NIT than without it. If a welfare program has a flat range before the phasedown begins, her budget line would extend northwest from point F parallel to MN (not shown) until the phasedown begins; then it gets flatter, taking the same slope as FD (not shown). She would choose a point F⬙ (not shown) that lies to the right of point O, so she would choose to work less under the welfare program than without it.
