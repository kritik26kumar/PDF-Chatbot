has ranged between 16% and 21% of GDP. Similarly, federal spending as a percentage of GDP today is about the same as 40 years ago—roughly 20%; over the past 40 years spending has ranged between 18% and 23% of GDP. The difference between federal spending and tax revenue in a given year—the federal deficit—averaged about 2% of GDP over the past 40 years but reached a peak of 6% in the mid-1980s. The federal government borrows whenever it runs a deficit. The federal government borrows, not by going to a bank, but by selling U.S. government securities (bonds) to the public—to domestic and foreign households and businesses, to state and local governments, and to foreign governments. # FIGURE 1.11 Federal Spending and Taxes as a Percentage of GDP
