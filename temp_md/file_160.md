\# Chapter 6 Health Insurance “Catastrophic” entails a 95% chance of a $4,400 burden (a $3,400 premium and $1,000 out of pocket) and a 5% chance of an $8,600 burden (a $3,400 premium and $5,200 out of pocket). Some people would prefer complete, but other people would prefer catastrophic. Why, then, don’t we see more people with catastrophic insurance? As we explain shortly, one reason is that there is a tax advantage to having your medical bills paid by an insurance company rather than by you, out of pocket, using your after-tax income. # X% Insurance Now consider insurance that pays a specific percentage (X%) of any medical bill and requires the patient to pay the remaining percentage (100% - X%). For example, assume the insurance plan pays 75% and requires the patient to pay 25%. We’ll call this “75% insurance.” The patient cost-sharing rate (25%) is sometimes called the coinsurance rate. With 75% insurance, the insurer reimburses the patient 75% of the medical bill, so the reimbursement rate (subsidy rate) is 75%. Thus, X% insurance means that the patient receives a reimbursement rate of X%. We can analyze the impact of 75% insurance using a supply and demand diagram as shown in Figure 6.1. The suppliers of medical care are doctors, hospitals, medical technology firms, drugs companies, and so forth; as indicated by the positively sloping supply (S) curve, the higher the price that the suppliers receive, the greater the quantity of medical care they will supply. The demanders of medical care are patients guided by their doctors. Their demand curve without insurance is D: If they must pay a price of $100, they would demand 100 units of medical care (point O); if they must pay a price... # FIGURE 6.1
