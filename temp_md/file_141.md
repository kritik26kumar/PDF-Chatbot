Cash surplus instead of imposing a cash burden. In the bottom graph, starting in 2010, the Trust Fund would grow faster; instead of peaking in 2030, it would still be growing in 2040. Slowing benefit growth and raising payroll tax growth are a repeat of what Congress and the president did in the mid-1980s. With bipartisan support providing political cover for both parties, Congress approved the key recommendation of a bipartisan commission headed by Alan Greenspan: Build up government bonds in the Social Security Trust Fund by raising payroll tax growth and slowing future benefit growth, thereby running annual surpluses for several decades and investing the surpluses in interest-earning U.S. government bonds. To slow future benefit growth, Congress scheduled a gradual increase in the full benefits age beginning in 2000 from 65 to 66 by 2005 and to 67 by 2022.
