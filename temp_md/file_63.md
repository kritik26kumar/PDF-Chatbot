been cut to 40, while firm L would keep abating until its emissions have been cut to 10. Here’s the key point: If the government sets the tax T equal to the marginal damage MD, what the firms then do for profit will unintentionally be what is best for society. To appreciate this achievement of the tax, suppose instead that the government required each firm to abate 25 units; equivalently, the government permitted each to emit 25 units. At first glance, the government requirement might appear reasonable—each firm would be required to abate the same quantity, 25, and each firm would be permitted to emit the same quantity, 25. However, the result of this government requirement would not be socially optimal. From Figure 2.5 you can see that abating the 25th unit costs firm H $100 (its MAC is
