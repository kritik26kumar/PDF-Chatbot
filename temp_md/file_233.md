\# Public Finance Spending on X

| ----------------- | - | --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---- |
|                   |   | Deduction | Tax Bracket | Tax Saving |      |
| Tax Deduction for | H | $1,000    | $1,000      | 35%        | $350 |
|                   | L | 1,000     | 1,000       | 15         | 150  |

As shown in Table 8.12, if H is in a 35% tax bracket, the $1,000 deduction reduces its tax by $350; if L is in a 15% tax bracket, the $1,000 deduction reduces its tax by $150. Thus, a deduction automatically gives a larger tax reduction to the household in the higher tax bracket. With a tax deduction, Congress has no control over the size of the assistance or how assistance varies with household income—both are determined by the household’s tax bracket. Another way is to give a household a tax credit for spending on X as shown in Table 8.13. The credit rate is set by Congress. Suppose the credit rate is set at 25% of the amount spent on X for all households (top block). Then the credit would reduce H’s tax by $250 and L’s tax by $250. Instead, Congress could vary the credit rate with household income. For example, it could set the credit rate at 35% for H and 15% for L (middle block); this would have the same effect as the tax deduction because H’s tax would be reduced by $350 and L’s by $150. Or it could set the credit rate 15% for H and 35% for L (bottom block), so H’s tax would be reduced by $150 and L’s by $350. With a tax credit, Congress controls both the size of the assistance and how assistance varies with household income. Consider a household with total income so low that it owes no income tax. Is there any way to encourage or reward such a household for spending on X? Not with a tax deduction or a regular tax credit. A tax deduction doesn’t help you if your income would not have been taxed. And a regular tax credit can help you only if you would have owed some tentative tax that can be reduced. However, there is a policy instrument that can encourage or reward a low-income household for spending on X: a refundable tax credit. Suppose Congress enacts a 25% refundable tax credit for spending on X. Then if a low-income household (that would owe zero income tax) spends $1,000 on X, it would file a tax return indicating its expenditure on X, and several weeks later it would receive a refund from the U.S. Treasury for $250. Congress has enacted very few refundable tax credits, but one is extremely important: the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), a refundable tax credit for low-income workers. We examine the EITC in Chapter 12, where we also consider the possibility of other refundable tax credits to assist low-income households. Spending on X
