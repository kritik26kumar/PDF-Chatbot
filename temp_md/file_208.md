\# Chapter 7 Tax Incidence and Inefficiency the revenue-maximizing rate tₘ. Thus, we will refer to Laffer’s hypothesis and not use the phrase “Laffer curve.” How should the disagreement be settled? Here a mistake in logic is often made. If the tax rate is cut in 2008, the key question is whether tax revenue in 2008 is greater or less than it would have been in 2008 if the rate had not been cut. The issue is not whether tax revenue in 2008 is greater or less than it was in 2007. It is easy to compare revenue in 2008 and 2007—the data are readily available—and it is almost always the case that revenue grows from one year to the next, just as GDP usually grows. An example will clarify. Suppose revenue in 2007 was $100 billion, and if the tax rate were held constant, suppose somehow we know with certainty that revenue in 2008 would have been $105 billion. Suppose the tax rate is cut in 2008, and revenue is $102 billion. Then the tax rate cut has caused revenue in 2008 to be less than it would have been ($102 billion versus $105 billion)—revenue decreases relative to what it would have been in 2008, even though revenue is greater than it was in 2007 ($102 billion versus $100 billion). Thus, we must compare actual tax revenue in 2008 to hypothetical tax revenue in 2008—what revenue would have been had the tax rate been held constant. We cannot know with certainty what would have happened had the tax rate been held constant, because it wasn’t held constant—it was cut. Anyone attempting to answer the key question must make an estimate of what the revenue would have been in 2008 if the tax rate had stayed constant, so that it can be compared to actual revenue in 2008. Thus, a test of Laffer’s hypothesis depends on the accuracy of the estimate of a hypothetical—what would have happened had the tax rate stayed constant. # Summary This chapter has two parts. The first part analyzes who bears the burden from a particular tax—that is, the incidence of the tax. The second part analyzes the inefficiency (efficiency loss) to the economy that results from particular taxes. The first part on incidence makes several points. People, not firms, ultimately bear all tax burdens. The distribution of the burden of a tax depends on relative elasticities. If demand is steeper (less elastic) than supply, then demanders bear most of the burden; if supply is steeper (less elastic) than demand, then suppliers bear most of the burden; whoever is less elastic bears most of the burden. The distribution of the burden doesn’t depend on who (demanders or suppliers) writes the check (pays the tax) to the government. The analysis is applied to a tax on wage income and a tax on capital income (income from saving). Using general equilibrium analysis, it is shown that a tax on capital income imposes some burden on labor, and a progressive wage tax imposes some burden on low-wage workers who are exempt from the tax. The second part on inefficiency makes several points. All taxes (except a lump-sum tax) distort behavior resulting in a change in the mix of goods and services or work versus leisure that reduces welfare. This loss in welfare is called the efficiency loss from the tax. The dollar magnitude of the efficiency loss is equal to the area of a BAD triangle. For a tax on a good, the BAD triangle is formed by the S and D curves for the good. Although levying the same tax rate on all goods doesn’t minimize efficiency loss, it may be sensible in practice. For a tax on labor income, the BAD triangle is formed by the S and D curves for labor. For a tax on capital income, the BAD triangle is formed by the S and D curves for saving. What matters for the efficiency loss is the marginal tax rate. A switch from a proportional income tax to a progressive income tax that raises the same revenue reduces inequality in after-tax incomes, decreases
