\# Chapter 10 State and Local Public Finance community’s budget line $300 (so it hits the vertical axis at $2,300) while leaving its slope –$20; equivalently, it would shift the community’s budget line to the right by 15 units of X ($300/$20 = 15), so the new budget line would be A´B´ and the community would choose point I (“income”). Clearly, the increase in X chosen by the community would be smaller with the $300 unconditional grant than with the $300 matching grant—to illustrate, the diagram shows an increase of just 2 units to 22. Suppose instead that the state gave the community a $300 grant that must be spent on X (a conditional block grant for X). The community would be able to buy 15 units of X without reducing its spending on other goods below $2,000. But thereafter, each additional unit of X would require it to spend $20 less on other goods. Thus, the community’s budget “line” would be ANB´. As the diagram shows, the community should choose an X of 22, exactly as it would under the $300 unconditional grant when its budget line was A´B´. In effect, the community should use the state grant of $300 to buy 15 units of X, which frees up $300 of its own money to be spent however it wants. Thus an open-ended matching grant, which causes a price reduction and makes the budget line flatter, results in a larger increase in X than an equal dollar unconditional block grant or conditional block grant for X—each of which has only an income effect that moves the budget line out parallel.
