\# Chapter 8 Income Taxes Why is tax on your income that is contributed to these accounts deferred until you withdraw it at retirement? One argument is that the deferral encourages greater saving for retirement. Again, a refundable tax credit may be a better way to encourage saving for retirement. # Exclusion of Capital Income in Roth IRAs If you save in a Roth individual retirement account, there is no deduction in the year you save (in contrast to a regular IRA), but all capital income earned will be excluded from taxation in future years (in contrast to regular saving), and there will be no tax when funds are withdrawn. The Roth IRA exclusion provides an incentive to save for retirement. # Exclusion of Interest from State and Local Bonds The state and local interest exclusion is a form of aid to state and local governments because they are able to pay a lower interest rate and still attract savers. As discussed in Chapter 10, cash grants from federal to state or local governments may be a better way to provide aid. # The Deferral of Tax on Unrealized Capital Gains Return to Table 8.8 and make just one change: Suppose that during the year the market value of your corporate stock rises $1,000—from $10,000 to $11,000. Then Table 8.8 becomes Table 8.9 (changed numbers are indicated in boldface). You’ve had a capital gain of $1,000. Your wealth has increased by $5,000—$4,000 in your bank account and $1,000 in your corporate stock. Your income equals your consumption ($36,000) plus your increase in wealth ($5,000)—so your income is $41,000. The sum of your wage income ($38,000), interest ($1,000), dividends ($1,000), and capital gain ($1,000) is also $41,000. Thus, you get the correct answer for your income ($41,000) when you include your capital gain of $1,000; therefore, your capital gain is a component of your income.
