| Period | Workers | Wage    | Tax    | Revenue  | Retirees | Benefit | Rate of Return |
| ------ | ------- | ------- | ------ | -------- | -------- | ------- | -------------- |
| 1      | 100     | $10,000 | $2,000 | $200,000 | —        | —       |                |
| 2      | 125     | 10,000  | 2,000  | 250,000  | 100      | $2,500  | 25%            |
| 1      | 100     | 10,000  | 2,000  | 200,000  | —        | —       |                |
| 2      | 100     | 12,000  | 2,400  | 240,000  | 100      | $2,400  | 20%            |
| 1      | 100     | 10,000  | 2,000  | 200,000  | —        | —       |                |
| 2      | 125     | 12,000  | 2,400  | 300,000  | 100      | $3,000  | 50%            |

Let’s examine this with a numerical example shown in Table 5.2. Assume that there are two equal-length life stages: work and retirement. Each person works in stage 1 and retires in stage 2. Think of the length of each stage and of each period in the table as 30 years. Assume that there are 100 workers in period 1 (so there will be 100 retirees in period 2), and each worker earns a wage of $10,000 and pays a 20% payroll tax of $2,000. What will each worker receive as a benefit upon retirement in period 2? In the workers-support-retirees system, each period the tax revenue raised from workers is paid out as benefits to retirees so: BR = tWL where t = the payroll tax rate W = the wage per worker (so T = tW is the tax per worker) L = the number of workers B = the benefit per retiree R = the number of retirees Here we simplify by assuming that all wage income is subject to payroll tax. We consider three cases shown in the three blocks of Table 5.2. In the first block of the table, the number of workers grows from 100 in period 1 to 125 in period 2 (25%), while the wage stays constant at $10,000, and tax per worker stays constant at $2,000. Revenue in period 2 will be $250,000, and the benefit per retiree in period 2 will be $2,500, so the rate of return is ($2,500/$2,000) = 1 + 25%. In the second block, the number of workers stays constant at 100, while the wage grows from $10,000 in period 1 to $12,000 in period 2 (20%), so tax per worker grows from $2,000 to $2,400 (20%). Revenue in period 2 will be $240,000, and the benefit in period 2 will be $2,400, so the rate of return is ($2,400/$2,000) = 1 + 20%. Finally, in the third block, the number of workers grows from 100 to 125 (25%), and the wage grows from $10,000 to $12,000 (20%). The benefit in period 2 will be $3,000, so the rate of return is ($3,000/$2,000) = 1 + 50%. In the box, we show how to derive a formula that links the rate of return r\* to the growth rate of labor gL and the growth rate of the wage gW. The formula is only valid when the payroll tax rate, the growth rate of labor, and the growth rate of the wage remain constant over time.
