\# Chapter Twelve # Low-Income Assistance Meredith Desmond Citizens differ in their philosophy on providing assistance to low-income people. Some prefer that assistance be provided through voluntary contributions to charities that administer the help, while others prefer having government provide assistance through direct spending or refundable tax credits; others support both methods. Some citizens support giving assistance to poor people regardless of why they are poor, but for many citizens, it matters why they are poor. Some citizens support giving cash assistance with no restrictions on how the money will be spent, but many citizens prefer assistance aimed at specific purposes. Voluntary giving to charities is encouraged by the federal tax deduction for charitable contributions, the exemption from tax of nonprofit charitable institutions, and the estate tax. Under the charitable deduction, every hundred dollars given to charity is a hundred dollars not subject to personal income tax (provided the household takes itemized deductions rather than the standard deduction). Under the nonprofit exemption, nonprofit charitable institutions are not subject to a corporate income tax. Under the estate tax, every hundred dollars given to charity at or before death is a hundred dollars not subject to the estate tax (the estate tax applies to only the top 1%, but these wealthy).
