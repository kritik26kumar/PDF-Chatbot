\# 254 Public Finance Different mixes and types of services and taxes. Those perceived to be working would be copied by other localities, while those perceived to be failing would be discarded. Under this process, homeowners pressure their local government to choose a desirable package of services and taxes and to provide services efficiently for two reasons. First, they consume the services and pay the taxes. Second, the better the job the local government does, the higher the home prices in the locality. This effect is called capitalization. Potential residents are willing to pay more for a home in a locality with a desirable service-tax mix that is provided efficiently. Thus, local homeowners have a financial stake in both monitoring their local government to ensure that it performs efficiently and in voting out officeholders who are poor managers. Such monitoring and voting should strengthen the Tiebout process. In this description of the efficiency of the Tiebout process, it has been implicitly assumed that local residents will bear the entire burden of the local taxes that are levied to finance the local public goods, so that potential residents compare the full cost to the benefit. Just as a market competition for private goods promotes efficiency when consumers must pay a price equal to the full cost of each private good they buy, a marketlike competition for local public goods promotes efficiency when each resident must bear a tax burden equal to the full cost of each public good that she “buys.” # Tax Exporting Local government officials who are elected by local residents might be tempted to levy taxes that do not—or at least appear not to—burden local residents; that is, they may be tempted to export the tax burden to outsiders. For example, the local government might levy a tax on business firms in the community that are owned and managed by, and employ, nonresidents. The local government might levy a tax on the wages of nonresidents who work in the community or the purchases of nonresidents who shop in the community. Of course, such tax exporting could prove counterproductive for local residents. Discouraging businesses from locating in the community and nonresidents from working and shopping in the community could end up reducing the property value of homes in the community and reducing local job opportunities and wages for residents. Thus, local government officials might decide, after reflection, that they should not attempt significant tax exporting and should instead levy taxes that burden mainly local residents, just as the Tiebout process assumes. We discuss the possibility of tax exporting later in this chapter. Here we simply note that the Tiebout process works best when local public goods that benefit local residents are paid for by local taxes that burden local residents rather than nonresidents. # Tax Competition A concern that has been raised about a competition among local governments is that it might result in a harmful tax competition to attract business firms. To attract firms and jobs, each local government might be driven to cut business taxes below other local governments, and the result might be a harmful race to the bottom that would eliminate local business taxes and place the entire local tax burden on residents, thereby resulting in an inadequate level of public services. However the level of public services might still be adequate. Economic efficiency is promoted whenever those who benefit must weigh the full cost of providing the benefit. Suppose residents, not business firms, benefit from local public services. For example, think of schools. With residents bearing the entire local tax burden, they would weigh the benefit of local public services against their full cost. The level of public services that results from such a weighing might be socially optimal. A community
