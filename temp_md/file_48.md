\# Chapter Two # Externalities and the Environment Royalty-Free/CORBIS This chapter concentrates on an extremely important negative externalityâ€”environmental pollution. Economic analysis has led virtually all economists to make a controversial recommendation: charge polluters a price (either by levying a pollution tax or by requiring polluters to buy a permit for each unit of pollutant they emit) in order to discourage pollution. By contrast, many noneconomists recommend other approaches to reducing pollution. Some would require (mandate) each polluter to cut back a particular amount or switch to a particular low-polluting technology or manufacture a low-polluting product. Others would subsidize low-polluting technologies or products. This chapter explains why economists prefer charging polluters a price. Recall from Chapter 1 that an externality exists whenever producers or consumers do not have to pay for a cost they generate or do not receive a payment for a benefit they generate. It should be emphasized that an externality can be negative or positive. 27
